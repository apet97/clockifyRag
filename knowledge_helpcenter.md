You can track time you spend working on tasks using a timer in one of the Clockify apps:

- Web app athttps://app.clockify.me/
- Browser extension forChrome/Firefox
- Desktop app forMac/Windows/Linux
- Mobile app forAndroid/iOS

All tracked data is synced online and available from anywhere.

For an overall guidance on how to track time via web app and browser extensions, watch the video and follow the instructions below.

## Tracking time from the web browser#

- Enter timer mode by clicking the clock icon in the upper right corner on the Time Tracker page
- Optionally type what you’re working on in theWhat are you working on?box
- Optionally, mark time as billable, select project/task, and add tags
- Start the timer by clicking theSTARTbutton
- When you finish working, stop the timer by clicking theSTOPbutton

Note that once you start the timer, it willkeep running until you stop it; it will keep running even if you leave the page or close the browser (unless you use the extension and have the option to stop it automatically).

When the timer is running, the favicon in the browser will change from black to blue so you have a visual cue to see if you maybe forgot to start or stop the timer. Also, Clockify will display how long the timer is running in the tab.

## Continuing time entries#

When you continue working on something, you can start a timer for that activity in one click.

To continue a time entry, find the time entry you want to continue recording in your timesheet and click the play icon. Clockify will copy all the info (description, project, billability, and tags) and the timer will start ticking.

## Shortcuts#

Keyboard shortcuts can be used on the Time Tracker page and will only work when you are not editing any fields (when your cursor is not active).

n = startNew timer;c =Continue latest entry.s =Stop current timer;m = switch toManual mode;

You can also use shortcuts inMac appandbrowser extension.

## Auto-complete#

You can easily find your old entries’ details with the auto-complete option. Simply start typing and a drop-down will open with up to 8 suggestions, which will be sorted chronologically.

You need to enter at least two characters and they can be related to any of these categories you previously entered: description, project, client, task, or tag.

Otherwise, if you just click on the empty description (What are you working on) field, it will pull your 8 latest time entries.

Autocomplete list takes into consideration last 250 time entries from the last 60 days. If an entry isn’t there, it won’t show up in autocomplete.

## Change start time of the running timer#

You can change the start time while the timer is running by clicking on the running time. Then you can manually type in your real start time.

This is useful when you start an activity but you can’t start the timer at that moment (e.g. you’re on a meeting and are away from the computer).

## Running multiple timers#

You can have only one running timer on a workspace. But, if you have multiple workspaces, you can have multiple timers running at the same time, one in each workspace.

You can quickly switch between workspaces by clicking on the menu in the upper-right corner and choose another workspace. You can also switch workspaces in all the apps created with that account.

Keep in mind that all the time you track in one workspace will not be available in the other workspaces. Each workspace is a self-contained account (but you can transfer entries between workspaces).

## Grouping and ungrouping time entries#

Time entries for the same activity are displayed as a single time entry. Editing the group will edit each individual time entry in the group.

If you wish to see entries in chronological order, you can disable time grouping in your Profile Settings:

- Click on the profile icon in the upper right corner and openProfile Settings
- Check/uncheck theGroup similar time entriesoption

## Time tracking apps#

In addition to tracking time in your browser tab, you can also track time from a mobile app (Android/iOS), desktop app (Mac,Windows,Linux), and browser extension (Chrome/Firefox).

By using a dedicated time tracking app, you don’t have to keep Clockify open in a tab all the time. Instead, you can track time from wherever it’s most convenient for you.

In addition to the regular time tracking features, apps also come with extra functionality that’s missing in the web version, likereminders,idle detection,automatic start/stop timer, and more.

## Email about a long-running timer#

If you forgot to stop the timer, Clockify can send you an email about a long-running timer (over 8 hours). You can turn on/off that option in yourProfile settings.

Time entries display the timestamp containing the time zone you currently set. If, when you stop the timer, the time automatically changes to a different time, check your time zone settings in theProfile settings.

## Stopping timer for another user#

Admins can stop another person’s timer by either:

- Logging into theiraccountand stopping the timer
- Selecting them on theCalendarpage and clicking stop on the block for which the timer is running
- Selecting their profile on akioskwhere they’re assigned and start/stop the timer (you can use UniversalPINto clock in/out for others)

## Hiding time tracker#

If you prefer to use the Timesheets mode and don’t need the Time tracker page, you can now hide it in the Workspace settings of your account.


# [ARTICLE] Edit time entries
https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/editing-time-entries

In this article

- Edit time entries in Detailed report
- Bulk edit in Time Tracker
- Update multiple time entries in a bulk
- Mark time entries as favorites
- Move time entries to a different workspace
- Delete time entries

You can edit any time entry you’ve made directly in your timesheet on the Timer Tracker page.

To change the description, simply click on it and type what you want. You can add up to 3000 characters as a time entry description. All changes are automatically saved.

You can also select or change projects, tasks, billability, tags, start and end times, date, and duration, by clicking what you want to change, and typing the new value.

The person who has created the time entry can edit it any time he or she wants. Admins can edit all time entries (inDetailed report), regardless of who created them.

## Edit time entries in Detailed report#

Admins can edit all time entries in theDetailed report. There, you canfilterall time entries by whatever criteria you need, and directly edit the results.

Editing time entries in Detailed Report is useful:

- When you’re cleansing data and want tofix incomplete time entries(like entries that have no description, no associated project, or are missing a tag).
- If you tracked more billable time than needed and want to“forgive“ some time entries,and mark them as non-billable.

## Bulk edit in Time Tracker#

You can also bulk edit your time entries on the Time tracker page when you click the little edit icon near the total number of hours you tracked that day. Bulk edit will then be enabled for that specific day.

If you use bulk edit to change tags for time entries, their existing tags will be replaced with a new tag. However, you can also use Add to existing and old tags will not be overwritten.

## Update multiple time entries in a bulk#

Bulk Edit is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace to any of the paid plans.

- Go to Detailed report
- Select check-boxes for the time entries you wish to update
- Once selected, clickBulk editat the top of the table
- Select which properties you wish to update and set new values
- ClickSaveto update all selected time entries with new values

When you’re adding tags to time entries, you can select whether you wish to add the new tags to existing ones, or to overwrite them.

Before editing, you can filter time entries you wish to update and then click the top checkbox to select all the filtered time entries with one click.

## Mark time entries as favorites#

If you work on a lot of projects, it can be overwhelming to keep track of the progress. By marking time entries as favorites (paid feature) you can easily access most commonly used time entries in the Time tracker when tracking time.

For more information on favorite entries, check outFavorite time entries.

## Move time entries to a different workspace#

Use theImport timesheet(paid feature) to move a lot of time entries from one workspace to another:

- Go toDetailed report
- Choose appropriate date range (and filter the report as needed)
- Export the report in CSV
- Log in to the other workspace
- Go to Settings > Import
- Upload the CSV (make sure it’sformatted correctly)
- Start the import

## Delete time entries#

If you want to delete a time entry, click on thethree dotson the far right side of the time entry you want to delete, selectDelete, and confirm.

If you started a timer by accident, you can click X to cancel the timer.

### Undo ‘delete’ action#

If you accidentally delete a time entry and need to restore it, follow these steps to quickly undo the action:

- After you clickDeleteto confirm the action, a success message will appear as a toast notification at the bottom-right corner of the screen
- Click theUndobutton within the notification
- Deleted entry, along with all its data, will be automatically restored across the Time tracker, Timesheet, Calendar and Detailed reports

Toast message for successful deletion lasts 10 seconds, during which the action can beundone. ‘Undo’ restores all data associated to the entry, including GPS location, required fields and screenshots. Entries deleted in a bulk action are all restored.


# [ARTICLE] Time categorization & tags
https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/categorizing-time-entries

In this article

- How to organize time entries
- Clients, projects, and tasks
- Change labels
- Manage clients
- Manage tags
- Advanced organization

Clockify lets you categorize and analyze time using a 4-level hierarchy: description, tasks, projects, and clients.

For further categorization, you can also use tags, which work regardless of the hierarchy.

If you wish to categorize time differently, you can rename Project, Client, and Task labels into something else.

## How to organize time entries#

- If you do client work, name projects with the title of the assignment given by your client (e.g. “E-commerce Analytics”, “Website Redesign”, “SuperApp”). You can also have a special project where you’ll put all non-billable time entries (e.g. emails, time-off, meetings).
- If you do client work but want to keep it simple, you can just use client’s name as the project name and then use tasks to indicate what type of service you’ve provided (you can also change theprojectlabel to sayclientinstead).
- If you have common projects for different clients, you can use projects for the type of service (e.g. marketing, development) and use tags to indicate for which client a particular time entry was.
- If you don’t work with clients, you can use projects as general areas of work (e.g. sales, operations, support).
- If you use Clockify for tracking personal productivity, you can name projects by activity (e.g. emails, working, learning, cooking).

## Clients, projects, and tasks#

Projectsare the main way in which you can organize your time in Clockify. At a higher level, you can group projects around clients (or departments or whatever else).Learn more about managing projects.

Clientsare used to organize projects. A client can have many projects, but a project can belong to only one client.

It’s not possible to add just a client to a time entry as clients are used as a grouping mechanism for projects. However, you can create a project named after a client. Alternatively, you can create a tag for each client and add it to a time entry, so you can later group entries by tag.

If you need more control, you can further classify time entries usingtasks(i.e. sub-projects or jobs) and use them to designate the type of work (e.g. design, writing, programming), or whatever else you want (e.g. bugs, sprint A, phase X).

While tasks are commonly used to designate the type of activity (e.g. Design, Coding), the description field is most commonly used for the actual thing you’ve worked on (e.g. “Fix bug #638”).

## Change labels#

By default, time in Clockify can be categorized by Client/Project/Task.

To change these labels into something else:

- Go to Settings
- FindOrganize time by
- Choose what you wish to rename

## Manage clients#

By default,ownersandadminscan create clients. However, this set of permissions can be modified ifWho can create projects and clientsis set toAdmins and managersorAnyonein theWorkspace settings.

Who can create clients if selected:

- Admins(default): admins
- Admins and project managers: admins and project manager
- Anyone: admins, projects managers, team managers, regular users

Regular users will be able to create clients when they create a new project. However, they still won’t be able to see theClientspage.

### How owners, admins and project managers can create clients#

If you’re the owner or an admin of the workspace, to create a client simply:

- Go toClientspage from the sidebar
- Enter the client’s name in theAdd new clientfield
- ClickAdd

### How regular users can create clients#

If you wantregular usersto be able to add clients:

- Admin or owner needs to setWho can create projects and clientstoAnyone
- A regular user can then go to the Projects page to create a project
- ClickSelect client
- Enter client name
- ClickCreate clientor pressCtrl /^ (Control) + Enter

If you want to create a client only, simply create the client with the mentioned steps above and cancel the project creation.

### Archive clients#

Only owners and admins of the workspace can archive clients. Only after the client is archived you will be able to delete it.

- Go to Clients page from sidebar
- Click on three dots next to the client’s name
- Choose Archive
- Confirm the action in the pop-up window. There you will also have the option to archive all projects assigned to that client

### Restore clients#

Only owners and admins of the workspace can restore archived clients. Clients can only be restored after being archived.

- Go to Clients page from sidebar
- Select Show archived or Show all from the drop-down menu
- Click on three dots next to the archived client’s name
- Choose Restore
- Confirm the action

### Delete clients#

Only owners and admins of the workspace can delete clients. Clients can only be deleted after being archived.

- Go to Clients page from sidebar
- Select Show archived or Show all from the drop-down menu
- Click on three dots next to the archived client’s name
- Choose Delete
- Confirm the action

#### Delete clients in bulk#

If you have a lot of archived clients and you’d like to clean up yourClientspage, you can bulk delete them in the following way:

- Check theNamebox on theClientspage
- ClickDelete
- Type DELETE in the popup windows
- ClickDeleteto confirm the action

All deleted clients will be removed from time entries they are assigned to.

## Manage tags#

When projects and tasks aren’t enough to keep things organized, use tags.

The best thing about tags is that they are available across the workspace. Tags work regardless of the project, so you can create one tag, use it on multiple projects and filter reports based on them. You can even use multiple tags to filter reports with more precision.

Tags can also be used to add additional information to time entries. For example, you can:

- Mark time entries withnon-standard billing rates or currenciesso you know how to invoice them
- Marktime entries you’ve invoicedwithinvoicedtag so you don’t bill a client twice (you can usebulk editto update multiple entries at once)
- Mark whattype of work or service you provide(e.g. project management, feedback, debugging, coding), so you can see how much time takes to perform a specific type of work across all projects
- Mark whatpart of businessyou’re working on (e.g. internal, support, client work, mobile)
- Mark the amount of time you workedovertime

Tags are useful because you can use them as keywords by which you canfilterreports to find exactly what you need.

Before you can use tags, you have to create them by typing a new tag name in the tag picker and pressingCtrl / ^ (Control) + Enter. Once you’ve created a tag, all users in your workspace can select it when tracking time.

Everyone can create tags (though you can limit creation to Admins only in workspace settings). Only admins can edit, and delete tags. You can create as many tags as you want.

### Create tags#

- Go to Tags page from sidebar
- Type tag name and click ADD

Or:

- Click tag icon on a time entry
- Start typing tag name
- ClickCreate tagor pressCtrl / ^ (Control) + Enter

### Archive tags#

- Go to Tags page from sidebar
- Click on three dots next to the tag’s name
- Choose Archive
- Confirm the action in the pop-up window.

Once the tag is archived you will be able to delete it.

### Restore tags#

- Go to Tags page from sidebar
- Select Show archived or Show all from the drop-down menu
- Click on three dots next to the archived tag’s name
- Choose Restore
- Confirm the action

### Delete tags#

- Go to Tags page from sidebar
- Select Show archived or Show all from the drop-down menu
- Click on three dots next to the archived tag’s name
- Choose Delete
- Confirm the action

Note: Tags first need to be archived in order to be deleted.

#### Delete tags in bulk#

- Check theNamebox on theTagspage
- ClickDelete
- Type DELETE in the popup windows
- ClickDeleteto confirm the action

All deleted tags will be removed from time entries they are assigned to.

### Filter reports by tags#

You can filter time entries in reports in three ways:

- Contains– all entries that contain that tag will be shown (e.g. if an entry has tag A and B, and you filterContains: A, that entry will show up)
- Doesn’t contain– only entries that don’t have that tag will be shown (e.g. if an entry has tag A and B, and you filterDoesn’t contain: A, that entry won’t show up)
- Contains only– only entries that have that and only that tag will be shown (e.g. if an entry has tag A and B, and you filterContains: only A, only that entry will show up)

### How editing tags works#

- If you change the name of the tag in Tags section, time entries that have this tag applied will remain tagged with the renamed tag
- If you use bulk edit to change tags on time entries, you will have the option to add a new tag to existing or overwrite existing
- If you delete a tag all time entries that had this tag applied will end up untagged.

## Advanced organization#

Clockify lets you categorize time even further withcustom fields.

Custom field is a paid feature which you can enable byupgradingto PRO plan.

Custom fields let your users add additional information to time entries (e.g. expenses, mileage, etc.), plus you can auto-categorize time entries based on a project.

For example, if some projects are done in one location and the others in another, you can create a custom field called location and tell which project belongs to which location. Then, when you download a report, you’ll be able to create acustom report, and group and sort time by location.


# [ARTICLE] Summary report

- Bar chart
- Breakdown table
- Detailed information
- More on reports

You can see where your company spends time using Summary report. It takes all the time entries in your account and groups them by project, client, user, groups, tag, or date.

Like in any other report, you can usefilter data, change time range,share report, andprint/exportthe results.

## Bar chart#

The bar chart shows you the summary of all time entries for each day in the selected date range. It also shows how much of it is billable (dark green) vs non-billable (light green), or the time that was spent working on a specific project.

Switch betweenBillabilityorProjectwith a dropdown on the right and hover over the chart to see the exact numbers.

## Breakdown table#

The pie chart shows you the summary of all time entries grouped by a certain criteria (project, client, user, group, tag, and date).

You can further breakdown data by sub groups.

For example, you can:

- Group by client -> user to seewho worked for what client
- Group by group -> user -> date to seewho worked when

You can click on the number next to the group to expand it and see a more detailed breakdown for that group.

To export data without billable amounts, clickShow amountand chooseHide amount.

## Detailed information#

By clicking on the item from the Summary report (e.g. user name, client, project etc.) theDetailed reportwill be opened with the appropriate filter applied. The Detailed report can be opened in the same window or in a separate tab for an easier overview and comparison.

- Editing time entries
- Exporting Detailed report
- Adding time for others in Detailed report
- More on reports

Detailed report lets you see, export, and edit full details of all the time entries. You can open the Detailed report by hovering over Report in the main Clockify sidebar and clicking Detailed.

## Editing time entries#

What makes Detailed report special is thatadmins can edit and delete time entries others made(regular members can only edit and delete time entries that belong to them). On the other hand, all users can immediately undo the ‘delete’ action from the success toast message they get after the entry is deleted.Workspace owners and adminscanadd entries to archived projectson Detailed reports.

Editing time entries in the Detailed report is useful when you’re cleaning up data and want to make sure all time entries are filled out correctly. For example, you can use filters to see all time entries that are missing aproject, or atagand add them right there and even adjust the size of columns, so all data is visible and properly displayed.

Although the option to merge projects is not available, you can achieve similar results by following the instructions in the Troubleshooting section.

## Exporting Detailed report#

Detailed report exportcan be done in a PDF, CSV or an Excel format. It can be useful when you need a file that contains all the details of each time entry (project, client, description, task, user, email, tags, who approved, billable status, start date, start time, end date, end time, duration, billable rate, billable amount, currency).

The export is also useful when you need more control over grouping time entries. For example, you can export your time entries in Excel file and then slice and dice data however you want.

Like in any other report, you can usefilters, change timeframe,save and sharethe report, andprint and exportthe results.

## Adding time for others in Detailed report#

If you’re an admin, you can add time on your team members’ behalf directly from the Detailed Reports page with just a few clicks.

Adding time for others is a Basic feature, which you can enable once you upgrade your workspace to the Basic subscription plan.

- Hover over Reports on the sidebar and click Detailed
- Click Add Time For Others button
- Click Users and choose Team member for whom you’d like to add time
- Enter start and end time and pick date

- Export report
- Customize export

You can export data and download reports in PDF, CSV and Excel, and then send the export to your accountant/payroll, keep as a personal backup, or import data into a spreadsheet and analyze the results. The exported file can contain the following time entry details: project, client, description, task, user, email, tags, billable status, start date, start time, end date, end time, duration (including overnight), billable rate, billable amount, currency.A PDF file can contain up to 3000 rows.

This feature is free, available on all plans.

To get a full export (with all time entries), go toDetailed report, choose the longest date range, and export the results. You can use this file for personal backup, or forimporting entriesinto another Clockify workspace or some other app.

## Export report#

To export a report:

- Go to the report you want to export
- Click Export
- Choose format and the report will be automatically saved on your computer

Only the data that’s in the report will be exported. So if you have filters applied, the export will only contain filtered data.

Grouping optionsinSummary reportwill affect how your exports look like. So for example, if you group by User and subgroup by Description, data will be grouped that way in the export also.

Export of Summary report doesn’t contain timestamps. If you need timestamps, you should export Detailed report.

If you wish to export time without billable data,you can clickShow amountand chooseHide amount.

Please, be aware that when you export the tag from one workspace that has commas in the name, and import that file, you get two tags instead of one. This is because you used a comma in a tag name.

For example:

- CreateSmith, Johntag
- Export report containing that tag in CSV format
- Import that CSV file again

You’ll get two tags, one for John, another for Smith.

## Customize export#

You can control what you wish to get in exports by usingcustomize exportfeature.

For example, you can disable certain information (user, charts, etc.) from appearing on PDF, change report name, use your company’s logo, and more.


# [ARTICLE] Filter reports
https://clockify.me/help/reports/filtering-reports

In this article

- Date ranges
- Filters
- Time format settings

To see exactly the time entries you need in a report, use date ranges and filters.

## Date ranges#

When you wish to see what you and your team worked on during a specific period:

- Go to any report
- ClickThis weekin the upper right corner
- Choose the starting date from the left calendar and the ending date from the right calendar

You can also quickly select one of the predefined options (Today/Yesterday, This/Last Week, Past Two Weeks, This/Last Month, and This/Last Year).

You can click < or > to see entries for previous or next week/month/year.

Only users onpaid planscan access data for date ranges longer than one year.

## Filters#

You can filter data in reports bycategory, client, currency, description, kiosk, note, project, status, tag, task, team, user’s ID andcustom fields.

To see Custom fields as filters, they first need to be selected from the Filter drop-down.

Simply set one or more filters at the top of the page, and generate a report containing only filtered entries by clicking Filter button.

You can also filter by missing data and find entries without a client, project, task, or tag.

If you’re using custom fields, you can click onFilterdropdown and enable filters by whichever custom fields you need (or disable regular filters you don’t use).

You can also filter time entries by description. For example, you can type in “updating overtime reports” to search for “Updating overtime reports” time entry.

To remove a filter, clickClear filters.

You can filter reports by tag using three mechanisms:

- Contains – the report will list all time entries that have the selected tag
- Doesn’t contain – the report will exclude all time entries that have the selected tag
- Contains only – the report will list only time entries that contain all the selected tags

If regular users can’t see other people’s time entries, they won’t see Team filter. Managers will see Team filter, but only their team members will appear in the dropdown.

## Time format settings#

You change how time is displayed in the time tracker and reports in yourProfile settings.


# [ARTICLE] Dashboard
https://clockify.me/help/reports/dashboard

In this article

- Only Me Dashboard
- Team Dashboard

Dashboard lets you quickly see where your time goes and what your team is working on.

## Only Me Dashboard#

Each person gets a personalized dashboard that shows the time they’ve tracked.

You can choose what you want the chart to show by clicking on the Project/Billability at the top right corner:

- Billability– compare billable vs non-billable time and see how much money you’ve earned
- Project– see how much time you’ve spent on each project

You can also see all your activities in a given period and how much time you’ve spent on each one. By default, you see your top 10 activities, but you can choose to see all unique activities you’ve worked on.

If you’re not a workspace admin andWho can see billable rates and amountsis set to Admins only in theWorkspace settings, billable amounts are not displayed.

## Team Dashboard#

Team Dashboard shows a breakdown of all the activity in your workspace. It shows the total amount of tracked time in your workspace, as well as what your team is working on.

You can switch between your personal and Team Dashboard by clicking on the Only Me/Team option at the top right corner.

The team activity table, that’s beneath the chart, lets you see:

- What each person in your team is currently working on(i.e. activity for which they have the timer running). If a person doesn’t have the timer currently running, you can see their most recently logged activity.
- Total tracked timefor each person in the workspace (even if they don’t have any tracked time in a given period)
- Time breakdownfor each person, either by billability or project

If you wish to see team activity table at the top of the page each time you open Team Dashboard, you can click on thePin to topicon, which is located in the upper right corner of the table.

Team Dashboard lists all the active workspace members. Users who are made inactive or are deleted from the workspace are not shown.

You can sort the table either by total tracked time (to see who tracked the most time) or by the latest activity (to see who’s currently active at the top).

Team Activity shows the most recent entry according to the date of an entry. So for example, if a person tracks time today, and then add time for yesterday, the Team Activity will show the entry from today as the most recent activity, until there’s a newer entry.

### Who can see what in the Team Dashboard#

Workspace owner and adminscan see everything (time and financials).

Projects are useful for grouping andcategorizing time entriesthat belong to the same type of work. Projects make it easier to analyze data, generate more useful reports, and see where and how you spend time.

Each project typically belongs to some client, but you can create a project without a client (e.g. internal company stuff). A client can have multiple projects, but a project can belong to only one client.

You can alsoimport projects and clientsfrom a file.

For an overall guidance on projects, watch the video and follow the instructions below.

## Create projects#

By default, only admins can create projects. However, this set of permissions can be modified ifWho can create projects and clientsis set toAdmins and managersorAnyonein theWorkspace settings.

Who can create projects if selected:

- Admins(default): admins
- Admins and project managers: admins and project manager
- Anyone: admins, projects managers, team managers, regular users

The person who creates the project automatically becomes its project manager meaning that they can view all tracked time on their projects, set estimates, add tasks, manage project access and modify all other aspects of the project.

To create a project:

- Go to Projects and clickCreate new project
- Name the project
- Select client (you can also create a new client here, by typing a name and clickingCreate client)
- Choose a project color from theCustomsection orcolor picker
- Choose visibility (public or private)
- ClickCreate

Once you’ve created a project, you can select it when tracking time. If you’ve set the project as private (visible only to a certaingroup), then only people who are on the project will be able to select it when tracking time. You can also adjust the size of columns (name, client, status, access) to make sure all data is properly displayed.

If you use the Clockify browser extension, you can track time on projects and tasks from theProjectspage.

For more information, check out theBrowser extensionpage.

### Quick create#

You can also add a project directly from the project picker while creating a new time entry.

Click on the+Projectfield to get a drop-down list of projects and start typing the name of your new project. Once you start typing the drop-down list will try to suggest a matching (existing) project name.

If that project does not exist, you will be offered the option to create a new project.

Click on the+ Create new projectbutton and a popup window with additional options will appear allowing you to name your project, assign a client, apply a project template and select if the project will be public or private.

You can also use a keyboard shortcutCtrl /^ (Control) + Enterto quickly create a project without additional details.

### Color picker#

TheCustomsection in thecolor pickerfor Projects allows you to save up to 8 custom colors.If you haven’t used custom colors yet, the section will show a+sign prompting you to add new ones.

Custom colors are consistent across all devices and modes.

## Archive projects#

Once you complete a project, you can archive it, so it’s no longer visible when tracking time.

To archive a project:

- Go to theProjectspage
- Click three dots next to the project you want to archive
- SelectArchive

You can check theAlso mark all tasks as donebox in a screen that pops up requiring you to confirm the action and all the tasks in the archived project will be marked asdone.

Once the project is archived you will be able to delete it.

To see archived projects, click theActivefilter at the top of the page, change it toArchivedand clickAPPLY FILTERto confirm the action.

To restore an archived project, click three dots next to it and selectRestore.

When you archive a project:

- All its data is still available
- Project’s time entries will still be shown in reports
- Archived projects won’t appear in reports as filters unless you selectAllorArchived
- Archived projects won’t be available in the project picker when creating new time entries
- Archived projects won’t appear onProjectspage (unless you selectArchived in the filter)

You can also archive tags and clients the same way you can archive projects.

## Delete projects#

Projects can only be deleted once they are archived.

To delete a project:

- Go to Projects page
- SelectArchivedorAllfrom the drop-down menu
- Click three dots next to the archived project’s name
- SelectDelete
- Confirm the action

Deleting a project will remove it from all time entries it is assigned to, but time will remain.

## Merge projects#

While it’s not possible to merge projects, you can filter entries of one of the projects you want to merge and assign it to the other projectin the Detailed report.

It is also possible to update multiple time entries at the same time with theBulk editfeature in the Detailed report.

Then, simplyarchiveanddeletethe project you don’t need.

## Manage people on projects#

To see how to change the project’s privacy settings, manage user access to a project, or set users as project managers, visitthis help article.

## Project status#

When you and your team start tracking time for projects and tasks, you’ll be able to track progress on each project using Project status.

To learn more about how to use project status, visitthis help article.

## Project note#

You can add additional information to projects by using a project note.  To learn more about how to format a project note, visitthis help article.

## Project name/client/color#

If you need to edit project name, client, color, or any other type of project setting, you can do that in theSettingstab.

- Go to the Projects page
- Choose the project
- Switch to the Project settings tab
- Edit project name, change/add client/project color

Changes you make will be immediately visible.

## Set project’s billable rate#

Clockify has 4 types ofbillable rates, one of which is the project billable rate. If set, this billable rate gets applied to each time entry created for this project.

The project billable rate can be overwritten by Projects’ member rate which you define in theprojects’ Accesstab if you want different users on the project to have different billable rates.

To set a billable rate for a specific project:

- Go to the Projects page
- Click on the name of the specific project
- Switch to the Project settings tab
- Set billable rate for the project

To set different pricing per client at the project level:

- Create different projects
- Assign them to respective clients
- Go to Projects and click the project name (which will bring you to Project edit page)
- Switch to the Project Settings tab
- Set the desired billable rate for the project.
- Repeat for each project for the specific client

## Filter and sort projects#

When you have a lot of projects, it can be difficult finding what you need. That’s when filters come in handy.

You can filter projects by their active status, client, users who are part of it, billability, and name.

You can sort projects alphabetically by clickingNameon the header of the project table. It is possible to sort projects by Client and Status as well.

## Create project from a template#

If you have a lot of similar projects, it’s a good idea to set up a template so you don’t have to create the same project over and over.

Projects you create with an existing template will have settings such as Billable Rates, Estimates, Tasks and Team already applied.

Project templatesare a paid feature, which you can enable once you upgrade your account.

## Add and edit tasks in a bulk#

Admins and owners can add and edit multiple tasks to multiple projects in a bulk. This option is available with all paid subscription plans.

After selecting projects, user can modify visibility, access, client, color, billability and tasks in theBulk editscreen.

By modifying tasks, user can be adding and editing the tasks in the selected projects.If theAdd to existingoption is selected, user is adding a task to all the selected projects. Up to 20 tasks can be added.If theOverwrite existingoption is selected, user is deleting all active and completed tasks in the selected projects and adding the newly created tasks.

After all the changes are saved, the newly added tasks will be visible in the task list in the alphabetical order.

## Manage clients#

By default,ownersandadminscan create clients. However, this set of permissions can be modified ifWho can create projects and clientsis set toAdmins and managersorAnyonein theWorkspace settings.

Who can create clients if selected:

- Admins(default): admins
- Admins and project managers: admins and project manager
- Anyone: admins, projects managers, team managers, regular users

Regular users will be able to create clients when they create a new project. However, they still won’t be able to see theClientspage.

### How owners and admins can create clients#

If you’re the owner or an admin of the workspace, to create a client simply:

- Go toClientspage from sidebar
- Enter the client’s name in theAdd new clientfield
- ClickAdd

### How project managers can create clients#

Project managers can create clients from the project picker when creating new time entry:

- Start tracking time from theTime trackingpage
- Click the+Projectbutton to create new project
- InCreate new projectscreen:Enter project nameSelect client name, or add new:Type client name in the search fieldClickAdd <client_name>clientorUseCtrl /^ (Control) + Entershortcut

# [ARTICLE] Set up project rates & estimates
https://clockify.me/help/projects/tracking-project-profitability

In this article

- Set manual project estimate
- Set task-based estimate
- Set project billable rate
- Set cost rate
- Generate project report

If you’re working on a fixed-fee project, tracking time is crucial to determining your actual cost and maintaining profitability. Knowing the actual time spent, you can assess the accuracy of your original estimates and set better prices for future work.

For example:

A project has a fixed price and will take50 hoursto finish (e.g., 20h for design, 30h for coding). If the work takes70 hoursto complete, which is20 hoursmore than the initial estimate, then you know you went over the estimate.

Time tracking allows you to:

- Negotiate with the client for a higher price or less work, if necessary
- Use accurate data to set better estimates for future projects, ensuring you maintain profitability

Before starting the project, configure your Clockify workspace to accurately categorize and track time entries. You can do this by:

- Creatingtagsto represent different types of activities (e.g., project management).
- Specifying the client’s name on theClientspage.

## Set manual project estimate#

1. Go to theProjectspage2. Click on a project3. ClickSettings4. SelectManualunderProject Estimate5. Enter the number of hours

## Set task-based estimate#

1. Go toProject settings2. SelectTask-basedunderProject estimate3. Set it to recur and include non-billable time (optional)

4. Go to theTaskstab5. Set an estimate for each task on the list

## Set project billable rate#

1. Go toProject settings2. ClickChangeunderProject billable rate3. Enter the amount4. ClickSave

## Set cost rate#

Cost rate is a paid feature, which you can enable by upgrading your workspace toPro or Enterprise plan.

1. Go toWorkspace settings2. EnableActivate cost rateunderCost and profit analysis3. ClickChange4. Enter the cost rate5. ClickSave

Tips for accurate estimates:

- Make sure every time entry is associated with the correct project and a specific task when tracking time.
- Check the project status to compare estimated time versus tracked time when reaching milestones.

## Generate project report#

When a project is done, use reports to analyze profitability and refine your future workflow.

1. Go toReports2. SelectSummary Report3. Apply the necessary filters, such as filtering by a specific project.4. Open theShow Allsettings dropdown and verify that theShow Amount,Show Cost, andShow Profitoptions are all selected.5. Click theExportdropdown menu and selectSave as CSV

From the generated report, you can analyze data to help identify activities that exceeded the planned duration, find the cause, and improve future estimates and pricing.

Within the reports, you can examine figures for billing, cost, orprofit


# [ARTICLE] Billing tracked time
https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/tracking-billable-time

In this article

- Set up projects
- Track time
- See time breakdown in reports
- Invoice tracked time

When you’re charging by the hour, you need to keep track of time you spend working so that you know how much to charge your clients.

In addition to tracking billable hours, you should also track non-billable time (e.g. emails, Skype calls, preparing invoices, etc.). You can’t have a real insight into your financial state if you don’t know how long tasks really take.

Clockify helps you see how much billable vs non-billable activity you do and how that affects your earnings.

Let’s say you have a new client and you want to track your billable rates.

Here’s what your Clockify workflow would look like:

## Set up projects#

- Definebillable ratefor each person in Team section and a default billable rate in Workspace Settings.
- Add a clienton Clients page
- Create anew projectin Projects section and select the client. If you want, you can also set up:Tasks, so you can select them when tracking time and later group time entries by task in reportsEstimates, so you can compare estimated vs tracked time on projects, andbudgetedvs spent moneyProject and task billable rates, so Clockify can use a different billable rate when calculating how much you’ve earned on that particular project or task
- Tasks, so you can select them when tracking time and later group time entries by task in reports
- Estimates, so you can compare estimated vs tracked time on projects, andbudgetedvs spent money
- Project and task billable rates, so Clockify can use a different billable rate when calculating how much you’ve earned on that particular project or task

## Track time#

- Start tracking timewhen you start working: type what you’re working on, select the project, click $ to mark time as billable, and start the timer
- Stop the timer when you stop working and the time will be added to your timesheet
- When you continue working on something, press play icon next to the appropriate time entry to start the timer for that activity again.
- When you’re having a meeting with the client, start the timer, type “Meeting”, choose project, and mark time as non-billable. By tracking non-billable time such as this, you’ll have a more realistic picture of how much time you’re really spending on the client (and not just the time you bill). You can also add ameetingtag so you can filter time entries by tags in Reports.

## See time breakdown in reports#

- When the time comes to bill your client at the end of the month, go to theSummary report, selectThis Month, the project (or only the client if you want to bill for multiple projects you do for them), show only billable time entries, and clickFilterto see time entries you need to invoice.
- Group by Project and subgroup by Time Entry to make data breakdown more useful.
- Export the reportwith a detailed time breakdown in PDF and send it to your client for review.
- If you have clients who want to see how much time you’ve tracked at any point, you can share a report and send the link to your client. Then, your client can then visit the report at any time and see what work has been done so far on their projects.
- If you need to “forgive” and write-off some time entries, you can go to theDetailed report, use filters to find the time entries you want to write off, and mark them as non-billable.

## Invoice tracked time#

- Createinvoicefor client
- Import billable uninvoiced time entries into the invoice and download the PDF
- If you have time entries that you don’t want to import into the invoice: you can select a different time range, choose which projects you don’t need, or manually remove those entries
- Mark invoice as sent or paid to know its status
- See all your invoices that are due soon and filter out the paid ones

- Assigning users to tasks
- Add tasks in Time Tracker
- Add tasks in Timesheet
- Add tasks in Calendar
- Mark tasks as done
- Delete tasks
- Rates and billable status

Tasks provide an extra layer of hierarchy within a project, functioning like sub-projects. They’re used to categorize time entries by type of activity, while the Description field is used for the specific work item.

## Create a task#

To create a task:

- Go to the desiredProject
- Open theTaskstab
- Type the task name and clickAdd
- Add the task details:
- Assignee –Select a user or group to indicate who works on the task
- Estimate –Set a time estimate (must be enabled in Project settings).
- Rename –Click on the task name to edit it

By default, owners and admins can create tasks, but you can modify this inWorkspace settings.

| Workspace setting | Who can create tasks |
| Admins(Default) | Admins |
| Admins and project managers | Admins and Project Managers |
| Anyone | Admins, Project Managers, Team Managers, and Regular Users |

## Assigning users to tasks#

The task assignee determines who can track time against that task:

- Anyone –Everyone who has access to the project can track time on the task.
- Specific User/Group –Only the assigned person or group can track time on the task.

Forprivate projects, the user must be added to the project first.

## Add tasks in Time Tracker#

1. Go to theTime Trackerpage2. Click on theTasks/Projectslink next to the description field3. Expand the project you’re working on to see the tasks4. Click the task you want to track5. Add a description for your task (optional)6. ClickStartto start the timer

## Add tasks in Timesheet#

1. Go toTimesheets2. Select theProject/Tasklink to initiate a new entry line3. Expand the relevant Project within the selection menu4. Choose the specific Task associated with your work5. Input the time duration into the appropriate day column

## Add tasks in Calendar#

1. Go to theCalendarpage2. Select the desired time block on the calendar to open the entry form3. Click theProjectfield to expand the selection menu4. Expand the relevant project to display its associated tasks5. Choose the specific task for this time entry6. Enter a Description for the entry (optional)7. ClickSave

## Mark tasks as done#

1. Go to theProjectspage2. Click on the project3. Click thethree-dot iconnext to the task you want to mark as done4. SelectMark as done

When a task is finished, mark it as done to streamline your view.

| Task Status | Behavior |
| Done | Hidden from the main project page and the time tracking picker (unless you selectShow doneorShow all). |
| Tracking | Time entries for done tasks will still appear in reports. |

Marking tasks as done is most useful if you organize projects as to-do lists. If you use tasks for fixed activity types, closing them may not be necessary.

## Delete tasks#

- Go to theProjectspage
- Select the relevant project
- Click on the three-dot icon next to the task you want to delete
- SelectMark as done
- Click on the three-dot icon again
- SelectDelete
- TypeDELETEon the confirmation window

Important note about deleting tasks:

- Only admins and project managers can delete tasks.
- All time entries associated with the deleted task will become without a task but will still be linked to the project.

## Rates and billable status#

To set specific hourly rates for tasks and mark them asBillable, you must first enabletask ratesin yourWorkspace settings.

### Add tasks from a template#

Project Templates is a paid feature and is available withany paid plan

If you regularly use the same task structure across multiple projects, you can use aProject Template. Templates automatically apply:

- Tasks
- Billable Rates
- Estimates
- Team members

- Set a billable rate for people on the project
- Project roles

## Project privacy settings#

There are two types of projects – Public and Private. When you create a project, you can choose whether it’ll be Private or Public (default option).

You can change the default option for project’s privacy in the Workspace settings.

Public projectsare:

- Accessible to all workspace users
- Everyone can select the project when tracking time
- Everyone can see all time entries for that project in reports

Private projectsare:

- Only accessible to project members
- Only project members can select the project when tracking time
- Members can only see their own tracked time in reports (ifHide time from usersis enabled)
- Only project managers can see all tracked time on their project in reports ifHide time from usersis enabled

Once you create a project, you can always change its visibility by selecting Public or Private in the project’s Access tab.

Only Admins and Project Managers can change visibility after a project is created.

Admins can see and edit all projects and time entries, no matter if the project is public or private.

By default, only admins can create projects but you can allow regular users to create projects and clients when you set Who can create projects and clients to Everyone in your Workspace settings.

## Add people to projects#

To invite people and groups on a project:

- Click on a project
- Go to the Access tab
- Click+ Add members
- Select people or groups you want to add to the project

People will automatically get access to the project once you add them (meaning, there’s no project invite).

Once people are added to the project, they can select the project whentracking time.

Only people who areinvitedto your workspace can be invited to a project.

## Remove people from projects#

To remove a user from a project, go to the Access tab of the project, click the three little dots near the user’s name and then clickRemove.

## Set a billable rate for people on the project#

If you want to assign a differentbillable ratefor each person on some particular project, go to the Projects page, click on the name of the project you want, switch to the Access tab and then define the billable rate for the users in the project.

## Project roles#

The user who creates a project automatically gets the Manager role on that project. A project can have more than one manager.

To give someone manager rights, go to the project’s Access tab, click three dots next to the person’s name, and select Give manager rights. To revoke manager role, click three dots next to the person’s name and select Revoke manager rights.

# [ARTICLE] Overview of hourly rates
https://clockify.me/help/reports/hourly-rates

In this article

- Hourly rate types
- Hourly rate hierarchy
- Applied billable rate
- Set custom currency
- Who can set hourly rates
- Share additional data with employees
- Project and task billability
- Who can see and change billable status of entries
- Historic rates

Clockify can apply different hourly rates to your billable time entries and show how much money you earn in reports.

Clockify multiplies each billable time entry with their corresponding hourly rate and that number is shown as earning in a report.

In order for Clockify to calculate hourly rates, you first have to mark time entries as billable in the Time Tracker (or in the Detailed report) by clicking on the $ sign.

If you don’t use hourly rates, you can completely remove all the billable information from interface for everyone by turning offActivate billable hoursin Workspace Settings > Permissions tab, or you can hide it just for regular users.

## Hourly rate types#

There are several types of hourly rates in Clockify:

- Workspace rate, which you define inWorkspacesettings; it gets applied to all billable time rates unless it gets overridden by a more specific billable rate
- Member rate, which you define onTeampage for each user
- Project rate, which you define for eachproject
- Task rate, if enabled in workspace settings
- Projects’ member rate, which you define inprojects’ Accesstab

In addition to billable rates, you can also have one more set of rates forlabor cost.

## Hourly rate hierarchy#

Project’s member rate > Task rate > Project rate > Member rate > Workspace rate

## Applied billable rate#

A more specific billable rate overrides a less specific one:Project’s member rate>Task rate>Project rate>Member rate>Workspace rate.

For example, let’s say you’re a freelancer and you have a default rate you charge on all projects. You define that rate as your workspace billable rate. Then, you also have a client to whom you charge a different rate. In that case, you can create a project, assign it to the client, and set the desired hourly rate for that project.

To set different pricing per client at project level:

- Create different projects
- Assign them to respective clients
- Go to Projects and click the project name
- ClickSettingstab
- Set the desired billable rate for each project inProject billable ratesection

You can’t assign a custom billable rate for a specific time entry. But, you can use a tag to indicate a special billable rate so you know how much to charge when preparing an invoice.

## Set custom currency#

To change currency, click on Settings in the left sidebar then when in theWorkspacesettings type your currency instead of USD. You can addmultiple currencieson a workspace, orassign different currencies to multiple clients.

Currency can only be edited by the workspace administrator and it’s applied to the whole account (including billable rates).

## Who can set hourly rates#

Only workspace admin can set hourly rates for workspace, user, and project.Project managers can set hourly rates for people on their projects ifWho can see billable ratesin workspace settings is set to everyone.Regular members can’t set or edit any hourly rates.

For more info, check out theUnderstanding user roles & access permissionsarticle.

## Share additional data with employees#

If you wish your employees to see their earnings and hourly rates, but don’t wish them to see other people’s rates or want to limit them to seeing just cost rates, you can create a shared report:

- Open Summary or Detailed report
- Filter by employee
- Choose if you wish to display amount, cost, or profit
- Click on share icon
- Name the report and set it to private
- Choose who can view the report
- Your employee can now access the report you’ve created

## Project and task billability#

You can change whether time entries on a project are billable or non-billable by default.

You can set project’s default billability status when you click on a project from the Projects page and go to theProject Settingstab.

If you set the project as billable, when someone tracks time and doesn’t specify billability, the time entry will be marked as billable (which you can edit later).

It’s possible to change the billable status the same way you set it, in the Project Settings tab. Once the project’s billable status is changed e.g. from billable to non-billable this will not affect previously created time entries. Their status will remain the same as it was when it was created. However, all new time entries linked to that project will automatically be set to the new status, in this case, non-billable.

If you have some tasks on project that are billable and some non-billable, you can choose their billable status by enablingtask ratesin workspace settings.

## Who can see and change billable status of entries#

You can set permissions so that only admins see billable status of time entries. This way, regular users won’t be able to see the currency symbol at all, and therefore, change the billable status of entries.

This option is in the Workspace Settings->Permission, and it is available if you upgrade to any paid plan. You can try out the feature for free by activating thefree 7-day trial(no credit card required).

## Historic rates#

When you change some hourly rate, that new rate will be applied only to new time entries you create from that moment on.

For example, if a team member’s rate is $20, and you change it to $40, all their existing time entries will still have the original $20 rate. But, if they create a new time entry (no matter for which date), that new entry will have the new $40 rate.

You can see each entry’s hourly rate when you hover over the amount in the Detailed report (as well as in CSV/Excel export).

### Applying new rates to existing time entries#

Time entries pick up the latest rate each time you update project, user, or billable status of a time entry.

To overwrite previous hourly rate:

- Make the new rate apply retroactively to existing entries from the screen where you change the rate (anypaid planfeature)
- Manually update time entries:Go to Time Tracker or Detailed reportClick on the billable icon to mark entry as non-billableClick again to mark it as billable (this will reset their rate to the latest one)You can manually update entries individually, or do it viabulk edit
- Go to Time Tracker or Detailed report
- Click on the billable icon to mark entry as non-billable
- Click again to mark it as billable (this will reset their rate to the latest one)
- You can manually update entries individually, or do it viabulk edit

To prevent losing a historic rate, you canlock timesheetsso regular users can no longer edit their old time or add time to the past. To prevent admins from making changes, you’ll need toapprove time.

To trackprojectprogress in Clockify, set estimates andbudget, and then compare estimated vs tracked in a project’s Status tab.

For an overall guidance on projects, watch the video and follow the instructions below.

## Estimates#

You can estimate the length of a project, and then monitor progress and compare estimated vs tracked time to see how well you and your team perform.

Estimates are useful because they let you see if youchargeenough for projects. Plus, estimates can help you get better at estimating future projects.

For example, when you compareestimated vs actually tracked timeon a project, you get a better sense of how long a project like that takes, which helps you give better quotes to clients and set better budgets.

There are twotypes of estimatesin Clockify:

- Manual estimate (for the whole project)
- Task-based estimate

To set an estimate for the whole project, go to that project’s Settings tab, select Time estimate, and type your estimate in hours underManual.

Another option is to set estimates on tasks by selectingTask-basedestimate. Then, the estimate field will appear for each task on the project’s Task page, and your whole project estimate will be a sum of all individual task estimates.

If you have fixed fee projects, you can set estimates in monetary values usingproject budget.

## Project status#

When you and your team start tracking time for projects and tasks, you’ll be able to track progress on each project using Project status.

Each project will display a status next to it, for example, 15 (of 25h), which means you estimated 25h and your team tracked 15h.

You can get more details about project status by clicking the bar icon or the project’s Status tab.

Project status lets you see progress at a glance. You can see:

- Total tracked time, and how much of it is billable
- How much you’ve earned on the project
- Time breakdown for each task (assignee, estimate, how much of it was tracked, and how much money you’ve earned on each task)

In the tasks table breakdown, you can sort tasks columns by clicking on a column by which you wish to sort tasks. You can also hide completed tasks by choosingShow activein the task filter at the top right corner of the table.

Adminscan view status for all projects.Project managerscan always see status for the projects they manage.Regular userscan see status for their projects, unless you disable it in workspace settings.

## Estimates in reports#

You can also see and exportestimates in the Summary report, alongside your tracked time.

To see estimates, switch theShow estimatesand you’ll see the estimate column when you have the report grouped by either project or task.

## Getting project status in PDF#

When you’re on a Projects page or on the status page of some individual project, you can get a nice print-friendly view by going to your browser’s options and clicking Print (or press Ctrl/Cmd+P).

When you’re in the browser’s print mode, you’ll get an option to save the page as PDF.

Apart from exporting project status in PDF format, you can also export all your projects and related data from theProjectspage as CSV or Excel files.

- Invite users manually
- Accept invite
- Revoke user’s invite
- Filter users
- Edit user profile
- Make someone admin
- Make someone owner
- Make someone Team manager
- Deactivate and delete user

In Clockify, you can have an unlimited number of users. This way, your whole team can track time. In order to do that, they first need to be invited to yourworkspace.

For step-by-step guidance on how to invite and manage users in Clockify, watch the video and follow the instructions below.

Only owners and admins can invite new users to a workspace, deactivate/delete users, revoke their invite and manage their details (set their billable rate, set as inactive, and assign to groups).

- ClickTeamin the main sidebar on the left
- Click onAdd new member/Add full member(ifkioskis activated) in the upper right corner
- Enter the email of the person you want to invite
- ClickSend invite

If you’d like to invite multiple users at once, enter the emails in the designated fields one below the other, or copy and paste the list of emails (e.g. mark@domain.com, jane@domain.com).If you’re using afree planyou can enter up to 5 email addresses at the same time (but you can invite anunlimited numberof users in total). If you’re on apaid plan, there’s no limit to the number of email addresses you can enter and thus the number of users you can invite at once.

Keep in mind thatpaid plans are charged per user seat. Learn more about how to manage user seats and paid planshere.

## Invite users manually#

If you’ve added a member, but they haven’t received an email, you can send them the invitation manually:

- Click on three dots next to member and chooseResend an invite email

Understanding user roles and permissions is essential for effective collaboration and efficient workflow management. This article provides an overview of the user roles and their corresponding access permissions in Clockify.

For more information aboutAdmin & owner,ManagerandRegular userroles and their access permissions, check out these individual articles.

Please keep in mind that CAKE.com permissions also apply, as CAKE.com operates as the central organization. For more details on CAKE.com permissions and how they affect individual products, please refer tothis article.

## Roles#

### Admins & owners#

Admins and owners have the highest level of access and control within Clockify. They are responsible for managing workspace settings, user permissions, and overall workspace administration.

Ownershold the highest level of authority in the Clockify app. As the individuals who created the workspace, they possess unparalleled control over workspace management. Owners have all the privileges of admins but also possess exclusive rights such as the ability to set up Single Sign-On (SSO). Additionally, owners are the only ones who can initiate the deletion of the entire workspace, which occurs if they leave or delete their account.

# [ARTICLE] Workspace in Clockify
https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/workspaces

In this article

- Workspace settings
- Manage workspace

A workspace is the basic organizational structure for all your time tracking activities. Think of it as your company’s dedicated, secure environment within Clockify, containing everything related to your team’s productivity.A default workspace is automatically created for you when you sign up for Clockify. You also get aCAKE.com Accountand organization, where you can join a workspace within an existingCAKE.com organization.

A single CAKE.com account allows you to create or join multiple, separate Clockify workspaces, each with its own users, projects, and time entries.

Your workspace holds all of your organization’s data and settings, such as:

- People:All your team members, their roles, and their access permissions.
- Projects & tasks:All active and archived projects, clients, and associated tasks.
- Time tracking logs:Every single time entry, timesheet, and approval record made by your team.
- Settings:All administrative configurations, from currency to branding.

## Workspace settings#

Only workspace Owners and Admins can see and edit Workspace settings.

You can modify most Clockify features in Workspace settings.

- Click on thethree-dotsnext to the workspace name
- ChooseWorkspace settings

Use workspace settings to make the following modifications:

- EnableTimesheet
- Upload company logo (which will be displayed inbranded reports)
- Change workspace name
- Set workspacebillable rateandcurrency
- Setweek startfor all workspace members
- Control who can see billable rates and amounts
- Set if projects are billable by default
- Choose how you want to group your projects (e.g. by Client)
- Set who cancreate projects,tasks,clients, andtags
- Choose if the duration format will be displayed as hh:mm or hh:mm:ss
- Enable project favorites
- Choose preferred number and currency format
- Managepaid features(like hiding time from users, lock timesheets, required fields, hiding pages, and time rounding)

### Multiple workspaces

Clockify workspaces are intentionally designed to be completely isolated. Time entries and data recorded in one workspace are not visible in any other.

This separation is invaluable for organizations that need to maintain strict data boundaries:

| Scenario | Recommended workspace strategy |
| Separate business units | Create a distinct workspace for each department (e.g. Marketing, Development) or subsidiary company.Note that having multiple workspaces means paying for more seats. If you don’t want the extra cost, having one workspace would be a more suitable option. |
| Personal vs. professional | Maintain a personal workspace for side projects or private time tracking, separate from your main company workspace. |
| Multiple clients | While not common, some companies might create separate workspaces for multiple clients |

Time entries are tied to the specific workspace they were made in and are not visible in others.

## Manage workspace#

Workspace Owners can manage their workspace through the centralCAKE.com Account. Here are all the workspaces of all the CAKE.com products that belong to their organization.

To manage CAKE.com account and workspace:

- Navigate to theProfile settingsat the top right corner of the screen
- ChooseManage CAKE.com Account
- You’ll jump to theCAKE.com Account/My Accountpage of your organization
- Go back to the homepage
- Click on theWorkspacespage

From this central hub, you can view, create, and join all the Clockify workspaces that are part of your organization.

# [ARTICLE] Share reports
https://clockify.me/help/reports/sharing-reports

In this article

- Share report
- Overview of shared reports
- Schedule reports
- Permissions

If you’d like to share your report, you can send a private link to the report to others so that they have access to data in real time, even if they don’t have a Clockify account.

This is afreefeature, available on all subscription plans.

## Share report#

- Customize report (filter, choose date range, grouping, sort, rounding, show/hide amount)
- Click on the share icon (located between Print and Rounding)
- Enter report name (this will be displayed as a title of the report in the header and in PDF export)
- Choose who can open link (public/private) and whether date range can be changed (lock dates)
- ClickCreate Link
- Copy the link and send it to others

Lock dates optionprevents viewers from seeing your shared report for different date ranges. This is disabled by default, so viewers can go through different date ranges when viewing the report.

If you choose a relative date range (e.g. This week, Last month, etc.) instead of a custom date range, you’ll also get theoption Always open as…This means that the report will be always displayed for the last or current day, week, or month when opened (which you can change depending on the settings of lock dates option).

For example, if you’re viewing a report forLast monthin May, when you clickShareyou’ll get an optionAlways open as…enabled by default. If you disable that option, the report will always show May when opened.

## Overview of shared reports#

You can access all the reports you’ve created, or that someone shared with you on theSharedtab.

Each report you’ve created, you can search viaSearch by namebox at the top of the page, or edit and delete by clicking on the three dots and choosing the proper option (edit sharing details, delete) or see which filters are applied in a report.

Shared reports always reflect the creator’s current set of permissions (what data they can see) and settings (their timezone and week start at the moment of creation).

For example, if you are an admin and you create a link to the report where you can see billable amounts and all time entries, but you later become a regular user, the link to the report won’t work because you as the creator of the link don’t have access to that information any more. Also, keep in mind that admins can see allpublicshared reports, even if they’re not shared with them directly.

Shared reports page shows the links you’ve personally created and those that other users shared with you. Additionally to that, you can see the list of users with whom you can share reports.

Once a shared report is deleted, the link will become inactive and browser will display a blank page.

## Schedule reports#

You canschedule a shared reportand receive it in your inbox each day, week, or month.

## Permissions#

### Who can open the link#

- Public: anyone with the link can open it.
- Private: no one can see it unless they have a Clockify account, are part of your workspace, and are part of the selectedgroup.

### What viewers can do#

- Can change the date range (unless you lock dates)
- Can export the results in PDF, CSV, and Excel
- Can sort by other criteria

### What viewers can’t do#

- Can’t change grouping and subgrouping options
- Can’t edit anything (it’s read-only)

- Click the icon with three lines (it’s next to the play button and beneath the clock icon) to enter manual mode
- Click the blue plus icon
- A popup window appears where you can enter start and end time, as well as all other details

Autocomplete

There’s an autocomplete option available when you click on an entry and start typing a description or when you click on the down arrow ( v ).

## Track breaks#

Use the break timer to track your breaks and have an overview of your and your team’s overall productivity.The break timer is available on all paid plans regardless of the user role. You only need to have a Break mode enabled in the workspace settings.

Each break entry contains entry’s description, project/task set in the workspace settings (if there is one), start, duration and end time and optionally billability, tags or custom fields.

If the Pomodoro timer is enabled, after the Pomodoro timer is started, the break starts as well. If the break is not enabled, then the Pomodoro is started as any regular time entry.

### Offline mode#

Break entry can also be started in the offline mode.

## Track time off and holidays#

Apart from tracking time, expenses and breaks, you can also track time off and holiday entries of your workspace members.

Time off and holiday entries can be created by Owners and Admins on the web app.

They are distinctly displayed on the tracking pages in the app.

The message with theUndobutton is only visible for 5 seconds. If you navigate to another screen, the message will persist until that period expires.

After you successfully clickUndo, a new message that saysEntry restoredwill appear briefly to confirm the action.

## Time entry list#

The time entry list shows you your most recent time entries. The list is organized by days, and each day contains the time entries you’ve made that day.

Each time entry shows the project, description, duration with tags and billability status (if any).

Duration format on the Mac desktop app depends on the duration format set in the Clockify workspace settings on the web version. For example, if you set the duration format to decimal on the web (e.g. 4.00), the desktop app will display the duration of tracker time in the same format, as well.

## Auto tracker#

In the Auto tracker, you can see a list of detected programs, descriptions of visited websites or open documents, activity start and end times, total duration, and percentage of idle time. Track your time across programs to generate timesheets based on your activity.

Auto tracker is not available if you’ve installed Clockify through the App Store due to store’s terms and conditions. If you need Auto tracker, you’ll have todownloadand install the version from our website.

Enabling Auto tracker: Open the app and click on the Auto tracker icon in the upper right corner.

To set after how long you want your activity to be tracked, click on theAuto trackerand then set it up through the Auto tracker settings.

- Auto tracker willtrack websites and programs that you view for more than 10 seconds(apps you use for less than that won’t show up). You can override this in the Auto tracker’s settings.
- If your computer goes to sleep, Auto tracker will stop recording.
- All of your data tracked with auto-tracker isprivate andonly you can see it. Data is not available on other devices. Other workspace users (including admins) do not have access to it.
- Data will be visible to other users in your workspace onlyafter you add it as an entryfrom the Auto tracker table.
- Data isstored for 45 daysand then deleted from the computer (there are no backups).
- Auto tracker will allow agap delay of up to 10 secondsbefore it considers you’ve changed apps
- Idle columnshows percentage of how much time you’ve been active vs inactive (no mouse or keyboard movement). Idle detection starts after 20 minutes of inactivity.
- You will also be able to see a timeline that visually shows time logs that are at least 10 min long.

To allow Auto tracker totrack which websites you visit and for how long, you need to:

- Go toSystem Preferences->Privacy->Automationand give Clockify Desktop app permissions to control Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- Allow Clockify access to Chrome, Firefox, and Safari when they ask

### Add recorded activities to Clockify#

To add items from Auto tracker to your Clockify account as time entries:

- Click on the+sign, under theAdd as entrycolumn
- Add more details (e.g. assign it to a project or change description)
- ClickSaveto create an entry in Clockify

App usage is automatically organized next to the auto-tracked entry table, with time spent on each app summarized. You can select these grouped entries and add them as time entries.To narrow down your options, filter auto-tracked entries by entering the app name, description, or URL. The table will show the relevant results, enabling you to select and merge them into a single time entry.You can also sort the activities by theIdlecolumn, either in ascending or descending order, to identify which activities had the most or least idle time.

To manage multiple entries, check the box at the top of the table. The following actions are available:

- Addselected– each item is added as a separate time entry in Clockify (you can add project/task/tag, but each entry retains its original description)
- Merge selected– all selected items are combined into a single time entry in Clockify (descriptions from each item are included, start time is taken from the earliest record, and the total duration is used to calculate the end time)
- Delete selected– selected items are permanently removed from the activity table

To hide items you’ve already added to Clockify, you can checkHide added itemsin the upper right corner.

Before creating a merged time entry, you can adjust itsstart time,end time, andduration. The duration reflects the total time of the merged auto-tracked entries, while the start time corresponds to the start of the first auto-tracked entry.

## Create new project, task or tag#

You can quicklycreate a new projectin theTime Entry Detailspopup window, by clickingCreate new project; then you can add the project name, the name of the client, and choose the project color.

After you add the project, you can thenadd a new task. When you clickCreate new task, a new input field appears, where you can enter the name of the task, estimate, and choose an assignee.

You canadd tagsin theTime Entry Detailspopup window, by clickingCreate new tag.

Don’t forget to clickSaveto save the added project/task/tag.

Regular (non-admin) team members aren’t able to create clients, projects, and tags if they are not granted these permissions. To give them such permissions, you will need to log in via Web browser and setWho can create projects and clientsandWho can create tagstoAnyonein the Workspace settings.

You can start the timer directly from the notification by clickingStart timerin the notification.

You can also setreminder start and end time, during which time the reminder will appear (e.g. from 08:00 to 16:00). Outside of those times, the reminder notifications won’t appear.

You can also setdays for which you want to enable/disable reminders. If you don’t want to receive reminders on Sundays for example, leave it unchecked.

You can set reminders by clicking the Settings icon and going toPreferences>Timertab.

## Detect idle time#

While tracking time, Clockify Desktop app can detect when you’re away from your computer so you don’t accidentally log that time. The app detects when you’re inactive based on your mouse movements.

If you’ve downloaded Clockify for Mac from the App Store, idle detection is not available. You candownload the version with idle detection here

You can enable more precise detection (which takes into account keyboard activity too):

- Go to your Mac’s  System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy tab
- In Accessibility section, add Clockify Desktop app (you can drag&drop it there from your Applications folder)
- Restart the app

If you set the detection interval to 10 minutes, after 10 minutes of no mouse activity, the app will ask you whether you want to include those previous 10 minutes (plus how long the timer was running after that) in your timesheet.

You have four options:

- Discard idle time: Discards idle time, and stops the running timer from when you went idle
- Discard idle and continue: Discards the idle time, and starts a new timer for the same activity
- Keep idle time: Ignores idle time, and adds it to the currently running time entry
- Add idle time as new time entry: Stops the timer, and adds idle time as a new time entry

## Auto-stop and start timer#

If you sometimes forget to stop the timer when you go on a break or are finished working, Mac desktop app can stop the running timer for you.

Mac app can also start the timer for you when you come back to work later so you don’t have to worry about managing timers.

In Preferences > Timer, you can choose in which cases Clockify should automatically start and/or stop the timer:

- When Mac goes to sleep, powers off, or when you close the lid (screen lock)
- When Mac wakes up, unlocks, or when app starts

## Pomodoro timer#

With the Pomodoro timer, you can set up notifications that will let you know when it’s time to take a break.

Clockify Desktop app will send you a notification when you reach the end of your current Pomodoro interval to let you know you should take a break.

After the break, you can continue tracking time on the latest task by clicking on that entry’s play icon, or start a brand new timer.

You can set just the Pomodoro timer (when to stop the timer and give you a notification), and you can also set breaks.

When Pomodoro break is enabled, and you reach the end of your Pomodoro time, Clockify will let you know with a notification to stop the timer for the current task. After that, a  new timer starts, with the description “Pomodoro break”. After it ends, the timer will stop, and you can start a new timer for anything you want.

You can start the timer for break directly from the notification by clickingStart breakin the notification.

You can enable Pomodoro timer and set your preferred Pomodoro and break intervals in Preferences > Timer tab.

IfFocus modeis enabled in your Mac’s system settings, please make sure that Clockify is added to your exceptions list. Otherwise, you won’t receive any notifications from Clockify.

## Default project#

If you work on the same project every day, set a default project. Then, all you have to do is type what you’re working on and start the timer, and the project will be selected automatically.

You can select:

- Fixed project, which will be always used when you start a timer for an entry without a project (until you change the default project)
- Last used project, and timer will pick up the most recently used available project from your list of time entries

You can enable default project in the app’s Settings > General tab.

## Screenshots#

Mac desktop app has an integratedscreenshot feature. After screenshots are enabled in the workspace settings by Admin users will be notified that screenshot capturing is activated.

## Keyboard shortcuts#

When you’re focused on the Clockify window, you can use a keyboard shortcut to quickly perform some action:

- Cmd+S – Start the timer
- Cmd+T – Stop the timer
- Cmd+N – Enter manual time entry mode
- Cmd + Shift + S – Save time entry when editing
- Cmd+D – Discard the timer
- Cmd+Y – Sync data
- Cmd+L – Log out

You can also define your own custom global shortcut for start/stop timer and hide/show app in Settings > Preferences > General.

## Offline support#

You can track time in Clockify on your Mac even offline.

You can regularly create time entries manually or start/stop the timer, and newly created time entries will be saved locally on your computer. When you get back online, the app will automatically sync all time entries.

When you’re offline, you will only be able to see information loaded while you were online (time entries, projects, tasks, tags, etc.). So projects, tasks, and tags are available for selection if they were loaded before you went offline.

It’s not possible to create new projects, tasks, tags, and clients while offline.

The app stores data locally, and syncs with the web version once you’re online again. If you want, you can also perform a manual sync by clicking the refresh icon.

If you are using the app in theoffline mode, please make sure you’ve synced your time entries with the cloud prior to logging out. If you fail to do that, all the data that is not synced at the moment of logging out, will be lost.

- Go toSystem preferences>Users and Groups
- OpenLoginitems tab
- Add the desired app to the list

Auto-start and stop can be enabled in Preferences > Timer.

You can set:

- A fixed project, which will be always used when you start a timer for an entry without a project (until you change the default project)
- Or selectLast used project, and the timer will pick up the most recently used available project from your list of time entries

### Offline mode#

You can track time in Clockify on your iPhone even offline. You can create time entries manually or start/stop the timer, and newly created time entries will be saved locally on your phone. When you get back online, the app will automatically sync all time entries.

When you’re offline, you will only be able to see information loaded while you were online (time entries, projects, tasks, tags, etc.). So projects, tasks, and tags are available for selection if they were loaded before you went offline.

It’s not possible to create new projects, tasks, tags, and clients while offline.

If you notice that the app is very slow, it probably means you have an unstable internet connection. In that case, enableForce offline modein Settings to improve performance. This will make the app behave as if it’s offline without you having to turn off your internet connection. After your turn offForce offline mode, the app will automatically sync all time entries.

If you are using the app in theoffline mode, please make sure you’ve synced your time entries with the cloud prior to logging out. If you fail to do that, all the data that is not synced at the moment of logging out, will be lost.


# [ARTICLE] Lock timesheets
https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/lock-timesheets

In this article

- Steps to lock timesheets
- Automatic lock
- How to set automatic lock
- Lock today's time
- Lock expenses

You can prevent employees from editing their old time entries or adding new entries to past dates by locking timesheets. Once you lock timesheets, you can safely send your reports to your clients or accountant knowing the data will stay accurate.

Lock timesheets is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace toStandard,Pro, orEnterpriseplan.

## Steps to lock timesheets#

- Navigate to the workspace name
- Open menu
- ChooseWorkspace settingsfrom the dropdown
- Switch to thePermissionstab
- ToggleLock entriesswitch to activate
- Specify a date before which all time entries will be locked
- Changes will be automatically saved upon selecting the date or toggling theLock entriesswitch

When entries are locked before, for example, April 15th, it means that regular users won’t be able to:

- Edit any time entries with the date April 14th or earlier
- Add new time entries with the date April 14th or earlier

Locking timesheets doesn’t affect administrators. Admins can still edit and add time in the locked period.

To unlock, move the switch back, and everyone will be able to edit all their time entries and add new ones to any date they want.

If you lock timesheets each month and have users across timezones, you should set the lock to the 2nd of each month. If you set it to 1st of the month, your team that’s in the later timezone won’t be able to enter dates for the last day in the previous month due to timezone difference.

## Automatic lock#

Set automatic lock and the lock date will get auto-updated each day, week, or month so you don’t have to do it manually anymore.

## How to set automatic lock#

- Open the menu next to the workspace name
- Go to workspace settings and switch to the Permissions tab
- SwitchAutomatically update lock dateto ON
- Select lock frequency (weekly, monthly, older than x days/weeks/months)

When selecting theWeeklyoption, you have to select two days: when the lock date gets updated (e.g. Wednesday) and the first day of the week in your company (e.g. Monday).  This way, when a new week starts (on Monday), your team can still add their missing hours for the previous week before that week gets locked (which happens on Wednesday).

When the automatic lock is enabled, you won’t be able to manually set a lock date.

When you setauto-update lock date older than 1 day, it means that at every end of the day, the lock date will be automatically updated so users cannot edit their yesterday’s hours.

The daily lock is updated every day at midnight, using the workspace owner’s time zone.

If you lock timesheets monthly and have users across timezones, you should set auto-lock to the 2nd of each month – otherwise, your team that’s in the later timezone won’t be able to enter dates for the last day in the month.

## Lock today’s time#

You can’t lock current or future dates.

To prevent people from adding time manually for today or the future (or changing the start/end time of their entries), you need to enable theForce timer.

## Lock expenses#

If you’re using expenses, keep in mind that lock date also affects expenses, meaning regular users won’t be able to add or edit expenses for locked dates.


# [ARTICLE] Time audit
https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/time-audit

In this article

- When to use time audit
- How to use time audit

Time audit helps you and your team find and fix faulty time entries.

Audits can be conducted both by admins and regular users:

- Admin can find all the faulty entries in the entire workspace with one click and fix them
- Team members can find their incomplete entries with one click and fix them

A time audit is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace to any of the paid plans.

To record and analyze changes made to time entries (e.g. who changed start time, deleted entry, etc.), you can use theAudit logfeature.

## When to use time audit#

- When you’re in the middle of something, you just want to start a timer and add a project/categorize the entry later.
- When you need to clean up timesheets before invoicing clients and you need to find entries that your team forgot to categorize.
- Find time entries you’ve made by accident (shorter than 1 minute or longer than 8 hours) so you can delete them.

## How to use time audit#

To use time audit:

- Go toDetailed report
- ClickTime Auditdrop-down
- Select what kind of entries you want to find (without a project/task, suspicious duration)
- Directly edit time entries (add project/task, delete, fix duration)

You can also usefilterson top of the audit.

When you selectSuspicious duration, you can define the duration that makes an entry suspicious. To clear suspicious duration filter, clickClear all.


# [ARTICLE] Time rounding
https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/time-rounding

In this article

- Turn on rounding
- What rounding affects when it's ON
- Rounding options

Round time entries up or down to the nearest minutes or hours so your reports are nice and neat, without all the confusing details.

For example, you can round time to the nearest whole minute in reports so you don’t get distracted by seconds when looking at a report. Or, you can round time to the nearest 6 minutes and export them to get all time entries displayed as a nice round number with just one decimal.

Time rounding is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace toStandard,Pro, orEnterprisepaid plan.

## Turn on rounding#

To round time entries, go to any report, and toggle the Rounding switch.

To choose a different rounding option, click on the dropdown next to Rounding and choose Settings.

Rounding is applied to each time entry. Rounding only affects the reports, meaning that the rounded values will only be displayed in the reports and exports.

## What rounding affects when it’s ON#

Time rounding only affects the reports and can be turned on and off as you wish.

- Calculating duration: Clockify will first round the duration of each time entry, and then add them up.
- Export: durations and values will be rounded in the export too.
- Calculated earnings: when calculating the value of your billable hours, Clockify takes rounded time entries.
- Detailed report: you can’t edit time entries in the Detailed report when the rounding is on.

Time rounding doesn’t change any data, only how it’s displayed, which can always be turned on/off. If you set the rounding to the nearest minute, your 00:10:56 time entry will be displayed as 00:11:00 once you turn the rounding on. And it will go back to 00:10:56 when you turn the rounding off.

## Rounding options#

You can set the rounding interval and how you want to round time entries in your workspace settings:

- Round down(for example: if the interval is set to 30min, a 1-29min entry will show up in reports as 0min)
- Round up(for example: if the interval is set to 30min, a 1-29min entry will show up in reports as 30min)
- Round to nearest(for example: if the interval is set to 30min, a 1-14min entry will show up in reports as 0min, and a 16-29min entry as 30min)

If your duration format is set to hh: mm in your Workspace settings, time entry will be rounded up to a minute. For example, if you tracked 0 hours, 1 minute, and 15 seconds (00:01:15), the entry will be shown as 0 hours and 2 minutes (00:02). This is not a part of the time rounding feature and you can change the duration format in the Workspace settings on any plan, including the free plan.


# [ARTICLE] Required fields
https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/required-fields

In this article

- How to enable required fields
- How it works

You can prevent users from adding incomplete time entries by using required fields. This will ensure that all time entries have a mandatory minimum amount of information assigned to them, so your reports are organized and accurate at all times.

Required fields is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace to any of the paid plans.

## How to enable required fields#

On the Workspace Settings page, administrators can define which fields on a time entry are mandatory before the time entry can be created.

You can make these fields mandatory:

- Project
- Task
- Tag
- Description

When the task is a required field, projects that don’t have tasks don’t show up in the project picker.

## How it works#

For example, if you check project and tags as required:

- No one can add a time entry without a project and tag (not even admins)
- The timer can be started but can’t be stopped until you add a project and tag
- Timesheet won’t let you add time without selecting a tag

- If you type three numbers, the first number will become the hour and last two will become minutes (e.g.130will become 1:30/1:30AM)

You can control whether you want Clockify to show time in 12-hour or 24-hour format in yourProfile settings.

Please note that, if the start and end time include an overnight period, there will be a superscript number next to the end time, showing how many additional days the time entry covers.

## Add time manually while your timer is running#

While it’s not possible to manually input time while you have a current timer running, you can use the duplicate option of a previous entry.

This will create a new time entry exactly as the previous one and you can change the details of that entry to whatever you need.

Clockify Time Tracker for browser lets you track time from anywhere on the web, without opening Clockify.

Get Chrome extension →

Get Firefox extension →

For step-by-step guidance on using Clockify in your browser, watch the video and follow the instructions below.

## How it works#

### Log in#

To start tracking time, you’ll first need to log in to the browser extension.

To log in:

- Click theLoginbutton
- You’ll be redirected to the web appLoginscreen
- Continue the process by entering and verifying your email

After you complete the login process, you can start using the extension and tracking time.

Users on custom domain or subdomain can also use the Chrome browser extension:

- Open the extension
- Find theLog in to custom domainorLog in to subdomain(Pro plan users on subdomain) link at the bottom of the extension screen

If you’re logging in with acustom domain, choose your custom address.If you’re logging in with asubdomain, enter subdomain name in the field (e.g. https://acme.clockify.me).

ClickSubmitand log in with your email or SSO.

### Time tracking#

Once you’ve logged in to the extension, type what you’re working on and start the timer.

To edit the running time, click on the running entry to bring up its details. There you can change the description, change running time, mark time as billable, and add project and tags.

You can also edit past time entries by clicking on them, or add time manually (once you switch to manual mode in the settings).

To quickly continue tracking time, click on the play icon for the time entry you wish to continue, and the timer will start ticking again for that entry.

Clockify also supports tracking holidays and time off on the web app. Time off and holiday entries are distinctly displayed in the tracker.

For more information on how to time off and holiday entries, check outTrack holidays & time off.

## Dark mode#

You can enable dark mode for the extension (as well as desktop and mobile app) in the app’s Settings.

## Track time from selected text#

- Go toSettings
- CheckEnable context menuoption
- Select any text in the browser (e.g. task name in Trello, email subject in Gmail, issue in Github)
- Right-click on the selected text
- ClickStart timer with descriptionin the right-click menu

## Track time from web app Projects page#

If you’re involved in an extensive project and task planning but would like to easily navigate through the Clockify web app, you have the option to start the timer from the created projects and tasks on theProjectspage.

In order to use this feature, you need to be logged in to the Clockify browser extension and the Clockify web app with the same account.

Once you’re logged in:

- Navigate to theProjectspage
- Find the project you’d like to track time for
- Hover over the project and the start button will appear
- Click the button
- Timer will start running and the time entry details window will appear
- Choose project task, make some other modifications, or stop the timer

To start the timer for a project task:

- Click on the project in theProjectspage
- Go to theTasktab
- Hover over the task and the start button will appear
- Click on the button
- Timer will start running and the time entry details window will appear
- The extension will pick up project and task name from the web appTask name will be additionally in the description

If you stop the timer in the extension, that entry will be added in the time tracker with all other info related to that entry.

Start time button is not available for archived projects and tasks.

## Default project and task#

If you work on the same project every day, set a default project or task. Then, all you have to do is type what you’re working on, start the timer, and the project will be selected automatically.

You can select:

- Fixed projectto always use when you start a timer for an entry without project
- Fixed taskto always use when you start a timer for an entry without project/task
- Last used projectto pick up most recently used available project (if task is required, task will also be picked up)

Enable default project in the Settings.

## Idle detection#

While tracking time, Clockify browser extension can detect when you’re away from your computer so you don’t accidentally log that time. The extension detects when you’re inactive based on your mouse and keyboard movements.

If there’s no mouse movement or keyboard strokes for X minutes, the timer will enter into idle mode. It will continue running, but it will treat those X minutes (and the time after that) as idle. When you become active, a notification will pop up, asking what you want to do with the idle time.

You can choose to:

- Discard idle time– The timer will be stopped and the detected idle time will be removed from its total.
- Discard and continue– The current timer will be stopped, the detected idle time will be removed from its total, and a new timer will immediately start for the same activity.
- Keep idle time– The timer will keep running as it is. In order to keep idle time in the extension, simply close or dismiss the notification.

Can’t see idle notification?

To set up idle time detection in the extension:

- Click on theClockify timer buttonlocated in the upper right-hand corner of your browser
- Open the extension settings by clicking on thehamburger icon
- Go toSettings
- SelectIdle detectioncheckbox
- Specify the number of minutes of inactivity after which the idle time will be detected
- ClickDone

Idle detection will work only if you started the timer from the extension (it won’t work if you started the timer from the web but have the extension installed).

## Pomodoro#

With the Pomodoro timer, set up notifications to let you know when it’s time to take a short break.

To enable Pomodoro:

- Open the extension settings by clicking on the hamburger icon
- Go toSettings
- Check theEnable Pomodoro timer

Timer interval– set how long will your Pomodoro session last.

Short break– set how long will your short break last.

Long break– set how long will your long break last and after how many short breaks it will occur. For example, if you set Long break starts after 3 short breaks your fourth break will be the long break.

For Long Break to work you would need to start/stop the timer from the notification popup. If you stop the timer manually, it will reset the count sessions and will start over.

If you have built-in notification sound enabled in Windows already, the notification will play both sounds so it’s best to have just one option enabled.

Disable/enable notification sound on Windows by going toSettings>System>Notifications & actionsthen click on theGoogle Chromeicon (note: this switch should still be set to ON) and switch off or onPlay sound when the notification arrives.

Default break project– Select the default project on which the break timer will be logged (Last used projectwill take the project/task from the timer just before the break).

Automaticbreaks– You can choose to automatically start/stop the timer when the Pomodoro period or break ends.

Focus mode– When enabled, your time logs will be hidden while you have the timer running and you’ll just see a visual representation of time left.

## Start/stop automatically#

You can automatically start/stop the timer when you open/close the browser so you don’t have to worry about clocking in when you start working or clocking out when you finish with your work.

- Open the extension settings by clicking on the hamburger icon
- Go toSettings
- Check theStart timer when browser startsand/orStop timer when browser closes

If you shut down your PC and leave the browser open the timer will continue working. You would have to close the browser first and then turn off the computer in order for the timer to stop.

In case you have both idle detection and auto-stop enabled, if the timer is stopped automatically, idle detection will not trigger (meaning idle time will be kept).

To see more about how it works, followthislink.

## Notifications#

Notifications are located under the bell icon at the top-right corner of the screen.

Synchronization across platforms

Notifications in the extensions sync with those on the web app. If you’ve read notifications on the web app, they’re marked as read in the Clockify extension.

Visual indicators for new notifications

New notifications are marked with an orange dot and a count. Click the bell to read them.

## Reminders#

Simply checkRemind to track timebox in the Clockify browser extension settings,specify the interval (e.g. 10 minutes), and you will receive a notification from Clockify every 10 minutes, reminding you to use the timer.

You can also setreminder start and end time, and the reminder notification will only appear during this time period (e.g. from 08:00 to 16:00).

And, you can also setdays for which you want to enable/disable reminders. If you don’t want to receive reminders on Sundays for example, leave it unchecked.

To see more about how it works, followthis link.

## Integrations#

Start Clockify timer in other web tools, likeJira,Trello,Asana,Gitlab,Basecamp, Slack,Github,Pumble,Google Calendar, Xero…

If you try to stop the timer from another website and you get an error, it means that project is arequired field. You’ll either have to add the project manually from extension, enable the creation of projects/tasks/tags in the extension’s settings, or disable required field (if you have Timesheet enabled, project field is automatically required).

The extension can also pick up project name from another app if there’s a project in Clockify with the same name, and create and select projects, tasks, and tags based on the integration.Here’s how.

You can also make Clockify work with self-hosted instances of software (like JIRA, Redmine, etc.), here’show.

When you start a timer via aStart timerbutton, a popup will appear where you can add a project and edit other information for the time entry. You can disable this in the extension’s Settings >Show post-startpopup.


# [ARTICLE] Users in different time zones
https://clockify.me/help/administration/time-zones

Clockify uses several time zones to record and display time values:

- Time zone from yourProfile settings(when you record time in the web app)
- Time zone from your device (when you record time in desktop/mobile app)
- UTC (stored in the database)
- Time zone from your Profile Settings (when displaying recorded time)

When you record time in Clockify mobile or desktop app (e.g. start a timer), your device’s system time is used. When you record time in Clockify web, time from Profile Settings is used. Then, Clockify converts that time to UTC and sends the converted value to the server. When you later view the time in reports, the time zone from your Profile Settings is used.

For example:

Jörg from Germany works from 09-10 AM (UTC+2) and records that time in Clockify. Clockify converts it to 07-08 AM (its corresponding UTC value) and stores it in the database. When Emily from New York runs the report, she sees that Jörg worked from 03-04 AM (displayed in her UTC-4 time).

This assumes the system time zone and the time zone in the Profile Settings match. If they don’t match, you will get a notification to fix it. If you don’t fix it,  your timesheet and reports will show different start and end time from the one you recorded.

If you wish to see a report in a different time zone (e.g. you want to analyze report for users in their native time zone), you can change your time zone in Profile Settings and then create a shared report (filtered by certain users) that you can open at any time (shared report remembers the time zone during its creation, so you can safely switch to your time zone and view the shared report in the time zone you’ve used during creation).


# [ARTICLE] Hide entries & pages
https://clockify.me/help/administration/hide-time

In this article

- Hide tracked time and expenses
- Hide pages

By default, all members of your workspace can see all time entries and expenses. However, you can hide this information, if necessary.

## Hide tracked time and expenses#

Hiding tracked time and expenses from other users in your workspace is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace to any of our paid plans.

To hide tracked time and expenses:

- OpenWorkspace settings
- ChoosePermissionstab
- FindRegular users can seesection
- Check the option that fits your preferences

You can choose if regular users can see:

- All tracked timeand expenses: regular users will be able to see the time entries and expenses made by other people on every project
- Only time and expenses on public projects: regular users will be able to see the time entries and expenses made by other people on public projects
- Only their own timeand expenses: regular users will only be able to see their own entriesand expenses

You can also choose whether users canaccess Team Dashboardand if they canaccess project status tab(so they can track progress and how much of the estimate remains). If users can access status but can’t see billable rates, they’ll only be able to see progress and all amounts will remain hidden.

This setting doesn’t affect project managers. Project managers, even though they’re regular users, can see all tracked time on projects where they have the manager role.

Learn more aboutwho can do and see what.

## Hide pages#

Additionally, you can hide Projects, Team, and reports pages from Regular users’ side bar.

Hiding pages affects managers differently:

- Project managers always see Reports and Projects pages
- Team managers always see Reports page

- Syncing projects and tasks
- Custom domains
- Disable integrations
- List of Clockify integrations
- FAQ

Start Clockify timer from within other web tools, likeJIRA,Trello,Asana,Todoist, and others (seeintegrations pagefor the full list).

Simply install theChrome extensionorFirefox extension, and a timer button will appear in your favorite web app’s tasks, to-dos, issues, leads, events, etc.

Thebrowser extension is open-sourced, so feel free to create new integrations or improve existing ones.

To use JIRA integration, you need to install theClockify plugin for JIRA. Check outthisHelp Center page for detailed instructions.

## Syncing projects and tasks#

The extension can also pick up project name from another app if there’s a project in Clockify with the same name (e.g. you have aProject Xin both Clockify and Asana/JIRA/Trello/Todoist).

Clockify extension can also create and select projects, tasks, and tags based on the integration:

- If there’s a project or task with the same name in Clockify, it will be selected
- If there’s no project or task and you have the permission to create it (based on workspace settings), a new one will be automatically created and selected

To enable creation of projects/tasks/tags, you first need to enable it in the extension’s Settings.

Each integration is different. For example, task and project can be created from Asana, Gitlab will also pick up tags, but Gmail won’t do anything except pick up description.

If you need support for this in other integrations, feel free tocontribute code to the extension on Github.

## Custom domains#

If you use a self-hosted tool that you use on a custom URL (e.g. you use YouTrack on mydomain.com), you’ll need to add your domain and connect it to the corresponding tool:

- Open extension
- Open settings (hamburger menu in the upper left corner)
- ClickIntegrations
- Scroll down and underCustom domainsenter your domain (e.g. mydomain.com)
- Select the tool that’s on that domain
- ClickAdd

## Disable integrations#

If you don’t want the button to appear in certain web apps, you can disable it inIntegrations.

- Open the extension
- Click on the menu icon in the upper right corner
- Click on theIntegrationsbutton and you’ll jump to the integrations list
- Uncheck the apps in which you don’t want to see theStart timerbutton

## FAQ#

### I get an error about missing project when I try to stop the timer#

If you have Timesheet enabled, project is automatically arequired field. To stop the timer, you’ll have to open your timer and select a project.

Tip: You can set a default project, so each time you start a timer, project is selected automatically (you can enable it by opening the extension and going to Settings).

### I’m using an on-premise version of some app#

No problem. In the extension options, selectIntegrations, scroll down to the bottom, select the tool you’re using (e.g. Gitlab), and enter your custom domain.

### Help, I don’t see the button#

If you don’t see the button, first make sure you’re logged in to the extension. If that doesn’t help, restart the browser. Also, make sure the integration is enabled in URL Permissions (when you open the extension, click on options icon in the upper right corner).

# [ARTICLE] Targets & reminders
https://clockify.me/help/administration/targets-reminders

In this article

- Set up timesheet reminders
- Emails for admins and managers
- Edit reminders
- Key considerations

In Clockify, you can set time tracking targets for your team, ensuring they stay on top of their daily, weekly, and monthly hours. If a team member doesn’t meet their target or logs more time than needed, they will automatically receive an email reminder.Managers and admins can also get notified on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis about team members who have missed their targets or tracked too much time.

Targets and reminders is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingto Standard, Pro, or Enterprise plan.

There are alsoYou forgot to start the timerreminders, which you can enable insidetime tracking apps(desktop app and browser extension, free feature).

### Types of reminders#

- User remindersnotify individual users if they haven’t tracked enough hours for a specified period (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Manager/Admin/Owner remindersinform team managers, admins and owners when any workspace member misses their target hours

## Set up timesheet reminders#

As an owner or admin, you can configure reminders for your users on theTeam page>Reminders tab.Here’s how to customize them:

- ChooseTheir work capacityto set reminders based on each user’s individual work capacity (calculated automatically)
- SelectCustom timeto set a fixed target of hoursYou can define the target hours for each user for daily, weekly, or monthly tracking.

Once configured, Clockify will automatically send reminder emails when a team member doesn’t meet their target or logs more than the target number of hours.

### Customize reminder settings

ForDaily,Weekly, andMonthlyreminders:

- Period selection: When setting reminders, you can select the time period (Daily, Weekly, Monthly)
- Target type: Choose whether reminders are based on the user’s work capacity or a custom-defined time target. If custom time is selected, you will be prompted to enter a specific number of hours.Defaults:Daily: 8 hoursWeekly: 40 hoursMonthly: 160 hoursAdjustable limits: The field for custom hours has a minimum of 0 hours and a maximum of:Daily: 24 hoursWeekly: 168 hoursMonthly: 744 hours
- Defaults:Daily: 8 hoursWeekly: 40 hoursMonthly: 160 hours
- Daily: 8 hours
- Weekly: 40 hours
- Monthly: 160 hours
- Adjustable limits: The field for custom hours has a minimum of 0 hours and a maximum of:Daily: 24 hoursWeekly: 168 hoursMonthly: 744 hours
- Daily: 24 hours
- Weekly: 168 hours
- Monthly: 744 hours

### User-specific reminders#

- Daily reminders: If you’ve setDay, team members will receive the reminder email the following day (you can choose workdays for when people have to fulfill their targets)
- Weekly reminders: If you’ve configured a weekly reminder, team members will receive the notification on the first day of the next week (week start). The default start day of the week can be set by the Owner or Admin in the Workspace settings under theWeek startsection. However, individual users can have their own Week start adjusted if the Owner or Admin updates their settings on theTeam page > Edit profile.For example, if Monday is set as the default start day but your first working day is Wednesday, reminders will be scheduled starting from Wednesday, aligning with your personal schedule. The reminder system will always use the user’s specific information. To ensure consistency, it’s a good idea for users to coordinate their start days, times, and time zones if possible.
- Monthly reminder: If you’ve set aMonth, team members will receive the reminder email on the first day of the next month

You can set up multiple reminder rules for each user or group (e.g. 7 hours per day minimum, but 40 hours per week and 150 hours per month).

User groups for bulk reminders

To save time, you can allocate users togroups. This allows you to assign reminders to multiple people at once instead of selecting each user individually.

Time off and holidays

There are no reminders during time off. Users on holidays or who have approved time off will not receive reminders for the days they’re absent.

Users who haven’t verified their email address won’t receive reminders.

## Emails for admins and managers#

If you wish to receive an email when someone forgets to log their time or they log too much time, click on a reminder’sThemoption, and select who also needs to receive the email (admin, team manager).

The reminders for them will include:

- Missed targets: When a team member’s tracked time is below the target, it will appear in red text in the email
- Summary email: All daily, weekly, and monthly reminders for team members can be included in one email
- Customized notes: The subject and email body will include a note with details about the specific time off taken by the user

## Edit reminders#

To edit a reminder simply click on the highlighted section (users, hours, etc.).

## Key considerations#

- Time off calculations: When a user requests time off (daily, half-day, or hourly), the system recalculates their available capacity. If the user has taken time off, their recalculated work capacity will be used for reminders.Full day off: The daily work capacity is set to 0 hoursHalf day off: The daily work capacity is halvedHourly off: The work capacity is reduced based on the approved hours
- Full day off: The daily work capacity is set to 0 hours
- Half day off: The daily work capacity is halved
- Hourly off: The work capacity is reduced based on the approved hours
- Non-working days: If a user is on a holiday or non-working day, no reminders will be sent for that day.
- Custom time target: If you set a custom time target, this will not be recalculated by the system, except for holidays, non-working days, or approved time off.

### Double time off requests

To prevent double time off requests, the system checks for overlapping requests:

- For the same user: A warning will appear if a time off request overlaps with an existing pending or approved request
- For another user: A warning will appear if a time off request overlaps with another user’s request

No reminders will be sent for weekends, holidays, or time off (whole days, half-days, or hourly policies).

In cases where tracked time is compared to the defined target, the email notifications will include a note indicating the time off taken that day


# [ARTICLE] Find projects/tasks quickly

In this article

- Compact project list
- Project and task favorites
- Task filter

## Compact project list#

If you have hundreds of clients, projects, and tasks, and have trouble finding the right one when tracking time, you might want to enable compact project list in your Personal Settings.

Compact project list collapses all projects under its client, making the list more manageable.

If your projects/clients have long name, you can expand the list across the whole screen.

## Project and task favorites#

If there are some projects and tasks you’re using often, you can mark them as favorite so they appear at the top of the project finder.

To use the Project favorites you will need to enable them in the Workspace settings first. To do this switch the toggle underProject favoritestoActivate project favorites.

You can mark a project as a favorite in the Projects page by clicking on the star next to it, or directly in the project finder.

Favorite projects are user specific. When you mark some project as a favorite, this doesn’t affect other users. Each user can have his or her own set of favorite projects.

## Task filter#

If you prefer to filter primarily by project or client, keep the task filter off and the filter will take into account:

- Project name
- Client name

However, if you use a lot of tasks when tracking time, you might want to activate the Task filter. This filter is user-specific so each user can activate it in theProfile settings(web app).

Once it’s selected, you can quickly find the task (and project and client) you’re looking for by using “task @project” syntax:

- Enter task name to find the task you need
- Further filter the results by adding @ prefix and typing project or client name

TheIdle time featuremonitors your activity. If you’re inactive for a set period and the timer stops, you’ll receive a notification about the idle duration.

TheAuto trackergives you a detailed overview of your digital activity:

- See a list of programs, URLs, or documents you’ve used
- See activity start and end times, total duration, and percentage of idle time

Customization:

- Hide specific items from your Auto tracker list
- Automatically start the Auto tracker with Clockify

- Group recorded activity by app name and description

TheAccounttab allows you to manage your Clockify account:

- Configure additionalAccount settingsin the Clockify web app
- Delete your account via yourCAKE.com Account managementweb page

## Auto tracker#

In Auto tracker provides you with a list of detected programs, descriptions of visited websites or open documents, activity start and end times, total duration, and percentage of idle time. Track your time across programs to generate timesheets based on your activity.

To start recording activities automatically, click on the A icon and then clickStart Recording.

Auto tracker will track websites and programs that you view for more than 15 seconds (apps you use less than that won’t show up). You can override this in Auto tracker’s settings.

In Auto tracker:

- All recorded data is stored locally on your computer (nothing is sent online)
- Only you can view the recorded activities
- You can view past data up to one week
- Data older than 45 days is automatically deleted forever (exact date displayed at the top of the page)
- URL of visited websites (you can disable this in settings)
- Idle column show percentage of time you’ve been active vs inactive (no mouse or keyboard movement)

### Add recorded activities to Clockify#

To add items from auto tracker to your Clockify account as time entries:

- Click on the+sign, under the Add as entry column
- Add more details (e.g. assign it to a project or change description)
- ClickSaveto create an entry in Clockify

App usage is automatically organized next to the auto-tracked entry table, with summarized time spent on each app. Select and edit multiple entries at once by checking the box at the header of the table, or by doing the right-click and selecting one of the following actions:

- Add Selected– each item is added as a separate time entry in Clockify (you can add project/task/tag, but each entry retains its original description)
- Merge Selected– all selected items are added as one time entry in Clockify (each description is added, start time is taken from the earliest record, and all durations are summarized and used to calculate end time)
- Delete Selected– items are forever cleared from the activity table

Before creating a merged time entry, you can adjust its start time, end time, and duration. The duration reflects the total time of the merged auto-tracked entries, while the start time corresponds to the start of the first auto-tracked entry.

To narrow down your options, filter auto-tracked entries by entering the app name, description, or URL. The table will show the relevant results, enabling you to select and merge them into a single time entry.You can also sort activities by theIdlecolumn, either in ascending or descending order, to easily identify those with the most or least idle time.

If you don’t need to see already added activities in the table, you can disable it in Auto tracker’s settings.

## Reminders#

You can tell Clockify to send you reminders to track time at regular time intervals.

Simply check theRemind me to track timebox, specify the interval (e.g. 10 minutes), and Clockify will show you a notification every 10 minutes, reminding you to use the timer.

You can start the timer directly from the notification by clickingStart timerin the notification.

You can also setreminder start and end time, during which time the reminder will appear (e.g. from 08:00 to 16:00). Outside of those times, the reminder notifications won’t appear.

You can also setdays for which you want to enable/disable reminders. If you don’t want to receive reminders on Sundays for example, leave it unchecked.

You can enable reminders by choosingPreferencesfrom thethree dotsmenu and going to theTime trackingtab.

## Idle detection#

If you’re tracking time while working, the idle detection feature is there to check your activity. If the user is inactive for a certain period of time and stops the timer, there is a notification that is related to the time when the user was inactive. Idle time detects the activity of the mouse and the keyboard and based on that, categorizes time as idle.

Configure idle time detection:

- Click on theClockify timerbutton
- Open settings
- ChoosePreferences
- Click onTimetrackingtab
- Set the timer according to your preferences
- CheckIdle time detectioncheckbox
- Enter the number of minutes after which the idle time will be detected (10 min by default)

When you have a timer running, your computer have been idle for selected number of minutes (no mouse or keyboard activity), and you return to the computer and move your mouse (or type on a keyboard), you’ll receive notification where you can choose what you wish to do with the inactive time:

- Discard idle time: Timer is stopped and the detected idle time is removed from its total
- Discard idle & continue:Timer is stopped, the detected idle time is removed from its total and new timer immediately starts for the same activity
- Keep idle time: Timer continues running as is; close the screen, or dismiss the notification to keep idle time in the app
- Add idle time as new time entry: Timer is stopped and idle time is added as new entry; two time entries are displayed with the second one being the time for which the user has been inactive

If the user is tracking time and that time is longer than the inactive time that was set, then, the idle time is classified as the time from when the user was inactive to the time they become active again e.g. For a 45-minute time entry, if the idle time is set to 15 minutes and if the user was inactive for 30 minutes, these 30 minutes will be qualified as idle time.

## Menu options#

To find the app’s menu, tap on the menu icon located in the upper right-hand corner. In this menu you can:

- Switch workspaces
- Refresh
- Use mini timer
- Auto tracker
- Preferences
- Visit the Reports on the Web
- Visit Clockify Help page for Windows article
- App version
- Log out

## Pomodoro timer#

With the Pomodoro timer, you can set up notifications that will let you know when it’s time to take a break.

Clockify desktop app will send you a notification when you reach the end of your current Pomodoro interval to let you know you should take a break.

After the break, you can continue tracking time on the latest task by clicking on that entry’s play icon, or start a brand new timer.

You can set just the Pomodoro timer (when to stop the timer and give you a notification), and you can also set breaks.

When Pomodoro break is enabled, and you reach the end of your Pomodoro time, Clockify will let you know with a notification to stop the timer for the current task. After that, a  new timer starts, with the description “Pomodoro break”. After it ends, the timer will stop, and you can start a new timer for anything you want.

You can start the timer for break directly from the notification by clickingStart breakin the notification.

You can enable Pomodoro timer and set your preferred Pomodoro and break intervals in Preferences >Time trackingtab.

## Shortcuts#

Navigating through Clockify is easy with shortcuts. These universal keyboard shortcuts are not set by default, but you can set and configure them yourself.

To configure shortcuts:

- Click on theClockify timerbutton
- Open settings
- ChoosePreferences
- Define your global shortcuts inGeneraltab

You can set shortcuts for showing and hiding the app, or continuing and stopping the timer.

## Screenshots#

Windows app has an integratedscreenshot feature.

If the screenshots are enabled in the workspace settings users will be informed that screenshot capturing is activated.

While the timer is running, the screenshot icon will be red, indicating that screenshots are taken once in every 5-minute interval.

## Offline support#

You can track time in Clockify Windows app even if you’re offline.

You can create time entries manually or start/stop the timer. Entries made while offline will be saved locally on your computer. Once you get back online, they’ll get synced with your web account.

When you’re offline, you won’t be able to see your other time entries, only those that were created while you were offline and which haven’t been synced yet.

Projects, tasks, and tags are not available while offline.

You can also enable theForce Offlinemode in the Settings, which can speed the app if you have an unstable connection, and later turn it off to sync entries.

If you are using the app in the offline mode, make sure to sync your time entries with the cloud prior to logging out because all of the data that is not synced at the moment of logging out will be lost.

In this article

- Create template
- Create project from template
- Remove template
- Change template

If you continuously work on similar projects, it’s a good idea to set up a project template so you don’t have to bother creating the same project over and over. Projects you create with an existing template will have settings such as Billable Rates, Estimates, Tasks, Team, andCustom Fieldsalready applied.

Project template is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace to any of the paid plans.

## Create template#

Here’s how you can set up a project as template:

- Go to yourProjectspage
- Click on thethree dotsnear the project’s name
- SelectSet as template

You can set up an unlimited number of templates.

If a user on a project set as template doesn’t have an account yet, they won’t have access to projects made from the template.

## Create project from template#

Now that you’ve set up a project template, you can use it when creating new projects.

- Go to yourProjectspage
- Click theCreate new projectbutton in the upper-right corner
- Click theNo templatefield
- Choose your template from the drop-down
- ClickCreate

## Remove template#

If you no longer want a certain project to serve as a template, you can easily remove it as a template.

- Go to yourProjectspage
- Click on thethree dotsnear the project’s name
- SelectDon’t use as template

If you archive a certain project that serves as a template, that’s okay, it will still be offered as a template until you manually remove it as a template.

Regular users can’t create new templates or delete existing ones. Also, only regular users assigned to the private project saved as template can use this template.

## Change template#

If you change a project that was saved as a template, projects created based on that template will not be changed.Only new projects created from the changed template will reflect the changes.

# [ARTICLE] Set up project alerts
https://clockify.me/help/projects/alerts

In this article

- Steps to set up project alerts
- Remove alerts

To keep a better track of your project estimates, you can set up Alerts and get an email notification when a project has reached a certain percentage of its estimated time or expenses.

Alerts is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace to Pro or Enterprise plan.

To get notified when someone tracks too much time, set upovertime reminders.

## Steps to set up project alerts#

Alerts apply to all projects that have estimates (you can’t set up alerts just for some specific projects).

If you exclude nonbillable time from project’s time estimate, both project status and alerts won’t count nonbillable time as part of the estimate.

You can choose who will receive alerts:

# [ARTICLE] Pomodoro, idle detection, reminders
https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/idle-detection-reminders

In this article

- Can't see notifications?
- Idle detection
- Pomodoro timer
- Automatic start and stop
- Reminders

Track time with greater accuracy so you can have a more accurate insight into how you really spend time with the help of idle detection, Pomodoro, automatic clock-in/clock-out, and reminders. You can enable them in: Preferences (Mac desktop appandWindows desktop app) / Settings (Chrome/Firefox extension).

## Can’t see notifications?#

If you can’t see notifications for idle time, reminders, or Pomodoro, you’ll have to allow the browser to send notifications.

To enable notifications on Windows:

- Go toNotifications & actions
- Turn ON theGet notifications from apps and senders
- Make sure your browser (Chrome or Firefox) in the app list is also set toON
- Turn on notificationsfrom Clockify in Chrome

## Idle detection#

Away from the computer but forgot to stop the timer? Clockify can detect if you accidentally leave a timer running when you leave your desk, and let you remove the idle time so your timesheets stay accurate.

Idle detection is designed to help you manage your own productivity. Because this information stays on your computer, no one else in your workspace, including admins, can see your idle activity.

#### How idle detection works#

If there’s no mouse movement or keyboard strokes for X minutes, the timer will enter into idle mode. It will continue running, but it will treat those X minutes (and the time after that) as idle. When you become active, a notification will pop up, asking what you want to do with the idle time.

You can choose to:

- Discard idle time– The timer will be stopped and the detected idle time will be removed from its total.
- Discard and continue– The current timer will be stopped, the detected idle time will be removed from its total, and a new timer will immediately start for the same activity.
- Keep idle time– The timer will keep running as it is. In order to keep idle time in the Chrome extension, simply close or dismiss the notification.

What will be discarded:  If you’ve been active for 1h, inactive for 30m, and idle time is triggered after 15m, Clockify will discard 30m (time needed for the idle time to trigger and the time after that), leaving you with a 1h time entry.

If you’ve been away from the computer but stopped the timer via another device in the meantime, idle detection popup won’t appear.

Note:Idle detection can’t differentiate accidental mouse movements from normal activity. For example, if someone accidentally bumps into your desk while you’re away, idle detection will register the accidental movement as a normal activity.

How to set up idle detection on:

- MacOS desktop app(Note: if you’ve downloaded Clockify for Mac from the App Store, idle detection is not available. You candownload the version with idle detection here.)
- Windows desktop app
- Chrome/Firefox extension

## Pomodoro timer#

If you’re using abrowser extension, or desktop app forWindowsorMac, you can set up notifications to let you know when it’s time to take a short break with the Pomodoro timer.

Once you’re done with your break you can select to continue the last entry or start a new one.

There is also an option to set aLong Breakwhere you can simply choose after how many short breaks you take a longer break to help recover from intense burst sessions.

For Long Break to work you would need to start/stop the timer from the notification pop up. If you stop the timer manually, it will reset the count sessions and start over.

If you don’t want to bother starting/stopping the timer, you can choose to do thisautomaticallywhen the Pomodoro period or break ends.

You can also enableFocus modein Settings. Focus mode hides your time log and just shows you a visual representation of time left.

You can also find a slightly different version of Pomodoro on ourMac desktop app.

## Automatic start and stop#

If you’re using thebrowser extension, Clockify can automatically start/stop the timer when the browser is opened/closed.

If you forget to stop the timer at the end of the workday, you can enable automatic stop and when the computer is locked/goes to sleep/shut down, the timer will also stop (currently available only forMac).

In case you have both idle detection and auto-stop enabled, if the timer is stopped automatically, idle detection will not trigger (meaning idle time will be kept).

You can also automatically start/stop the timer at a certain time of the day usingZapier(e.g. automatically start the timer at 9 am and end any currently running timer at 5 pm).

## Reminders#

If you keep forgetting to start a timer, Clockify can send you reminders to do that.

Choose your working days, working hours, and after how much time you wish to be reminded.

For example, if it’s Monday – Friday between 9 am – 5 pm and you haven’t started the timer for 30 minutes, you’ll get the notification. You can start a new timer from there, or continue the latest one.

In addition to the time tracking reminder notifications, Clockify can also send your teamdaily and weekly remindersvia email (e.g. if someone doesn’t log their target of 40h/week).

Weekly reminders will be sent on the day you set as the first day of the week in theProfile settings.

E.g.If Monday is set as the first day in a weekly reminder and my first working day is Wednesday, a reminder will start counting from Wednesday (my first day).

Reminder always picks up user’s information. If possible, check with users to set the same day, time and timezone.

How to set up reminders on:

- MacOS desktop app
- Windows desktop app
- Chrome/Firefox extension

# [ARTICLE] Customize reports
https://clockify.me/help/reports/creating-custom-reports

In this article

- Create custom report
- Additional dimensions
- Overlapping entries

If Clockify’s built-in reports andcustomization optionsdon’t provide the structure you need, create your own report using pivot tables in Excel/Google Sheets.

Simply export the Detailed report’s as CSV or Excel, and you can create any kind of report you want:

- Total hours (or amount) broken down by client > project > task > description
- Monthly report with total hours (or amount) per project (or user) per day

See example (Google Sheets)

## Create custom report#

Create a custom report in the following way:

- Export Clockify’s Detailed report in CSV or Excel and open it in Google Sheets or Excel
- Select the whole table
- Excel: go to Insert > Pivot Table; Google Sheets: go to Insert > Pivot Table
- Click OK
- Choose what fields to show in rows/columns, and what to display as values. Example: “Row: Project”, “Column: User”, “Value: Duration (decimal)”

## Additional dimensions#

You can enrich reports usingcustom fieldson time entries. Your users can track all sorts of things, like expenses, mileage, units, etc.

You can also add metadata to time entries using custom fields on projects. That way, you’ll have more options for grouping time in pivot tables.

Download sample report with custom fields (Excel)

## Overlapping entries#

If you have entries with overlapping start and end times, you can easily find them in Excel or Google Sheets.

- Export Clockify’s Detailed report in CSV
- Open CSV in Excel/Google Sheets
- Select all data and sort it by: User>Start Date>Start Time
- Create a newOverlapcolumn
- For the first record, use this formula: =IF(OR(IF($F1=$F2, IF($I2=$I1, IF($L1>$J2, true, false))),IF($F2=$F3, IF($I2=$I3, IF($L2>$J3, true, false)))),”overlap”, “ok”)
- Expand and apply the formula for each row
- Apply conditional formatting to highlight overlapping time entries
- Create pivot table based on the data in the table
- In Pivot table, select:Row:Overlap,Value:Overlap (count)
- Click on the overlapping count to see only the overlapping entries in a new sheet

How the formula works: Once all the entries are sorted, the formula compares the previous and the next row. If the rows are from the same user and from the same date, it looks if the entry’s start time overlaps with previous entry’s end time or if its end time overlaps with next entry’s start time.

See example of overlapping entries (Google Sheets)

- Number– Accepts only numerical values
- Link– Accepts a URL for files or websites
- Switch– Provides a simpleYes/Notoggle
- Select– Lets you choose only one option from a predefined list
- Select Multiple– Lets you choose multiple options from a predefined list

You can also setWho can editto eitherEveryoneorAdmins.

If you set a field to beAdmin-only editable, regular users can’t change its value, but they can still see it on their time entries.

You can create up to 50 custom fields.

## Activate custom fields#

Users won’t see custom fields until you activate them. To activate custom fields:

1. Go toWorkspace settings2. ClickCustom Fields3. Drag the field from theAvailablecolumn and drop it to theVisibleslot in theActivecolumn.

A maximum offive (5)active visible fields is allowed for the entire workspace.

Active visible fields will appear in the Timesheet and Time Tracker for everyone in the workspace.

## Invisible fields#

Invisible fields aren’t visible to users in the time entries, although they will exist on the entries and appear in Excel/CSV exports of theDetailed Report.Invisible fields are used to:

- Automatically inherit metadata (such as project ID) from the project
- Update entries via API or integrations

## Customize fields by project#

You can override workspace-level settings and apply custom fields to individual projects.

1. Go to theProjectspage2. Click on the project3. Go toSettings4. ClickCustom Fields5. Find theAdditional fieldssection6. Manage visibility and set default values for active fields

You can have up to10 visible fieldson asingleproject

Be careful when setting default values on a project. A default value always overrides any existing custom field value on a time entry when a user changes the entry’s project.

## Advanced usage#

You can use the four core mechanisms below to customize your workflow:

| Permissions | Visibility | Default value | Use case |
| Everyone | Visible | Empty | Capture user input (e.g., mileage, receipts) |
| Everyone | Invisible | Inherits | Stamp entries with project metadata (e.g., project ID) |
| Admins | Visible | Inherits | Show project information for user reference |
| Admins | Invisible | Empty | Prepare entries for admin-only API updates |

## Make a custom field required#

You can set a custom field as required to ensure users always enter data for a field.

1. Set the custom field asVisible2. SetWho can edittoEveryoneor define a default value3. Navigate toWorkspace Settings > General4. Select the field under theDon’t allow saving time withoutsection

## Edit custom field#

When you edit a field, the change doesn’t impact older entries. You must manually update existing time entries to add a newly created field or change its value.

To edit a field:1. Navigate toWorkspace settings2. SelectCustom Fields3. Find the fieldyou wantto edit in either theActiveorAvailablecolumn4. Click theexpand buttonnext to the field name5. Make your changes:

- Modify the field name
- Change theWho can editpermission
- Update the options (forSelect/Select Multiplefields)

6. ClickSaveto apply your changes

## Deactivate custom field#

Deactivating a field is applicable if you want to retain data from previous entries but don’t want to use the field in new entries.

To deactivate a field:

1. Go toWorkspace settings > Custom Fields2. Move the field from theActive fieldscolumn to theAvailable fieldscolumn.

## Delete custom field#

When you delete a custom field, it permanently removes the field and all its data from every time entry in the workspace. There isn’t an undo option.

To delete a custom field:1. Go toWorkspace settings > Custom Fields2. Click the expand button next to the field name you want to delete3.  Scroll down and clickDelete4. Type DELETE to confirm

## Custom fields in reports#

You can retrieve custom field data for analysis in pivot tables using theexport CSV/Excel featurein the Detailed Report.

Data can be filtered using custom fields and won’t affect other users.

Download sample report (Excel)

## Import custom fields#

Custom field data can be imported using aCSV filethat contains time entries. Ensure the column headers are in English and the time duration format matches your workspace settings.

- Go toWorkspace Settings > Import.
- Uploadyour CSV file.
- Reviewthe import analysis and clickStart import.


# [ARTICLE] View tracked time & expenses
https://clockify.me/help/reports/viewing-your-employees-hours

In this article

- Reports
- Individual employee report
- Customize reports
- Employees' hours in Timesheet
- Current work and tracked time
- Below or above target notification
- Tracked time not visible in reports

The Time Tracker page only shows your own time entries, but you can still view your employees’ hours in several ways depending on how you want your data to be presented.

## Reports#

There are three types of reports in Clockify: Summary, Detailed, and Weekly report.

The best thing about theSummary reportis that it groups your time entries in lots of different ways (by project, client, user, group, tag, month, week and date), so you can get the data exactly as you need it for any date range you want.

If you’d like to view your employees’ hours, the most common scenario to get this info would be to group the data by User and subgroup it by Project. You can further subgroup it by Task. This way you’ll get a breakdown of your employees’ hours by specific tasks while working on certain project.

Another useful way to view your employees’ hours is by grouping them by Date so you’ll see the total of hours each employee tracked per day.

This is great if you need to get a bi-weekly or monthly report of your team’s hours so the Weekly report doesn’t cut it.

This report has three levels of grouping so you can have a more granular view of your data.

TheWeekly reportis great if you check your employees’ hours each week so this is a set date range that works for you. You can also get a breakdown by User or Project.

While there’s no option to change a date range in the Weekly report to show more than one week at a time, you can use the Summary report, select any date range at the top right corner of the page and group the report by User and Date to see the total of hours each employee tracked per day.

TheDetailed reportwill let you see all the details of your team’s time entries one by one, not grouped or summarized. It’s also possible for an Admin to edit the team’s time entries in this report.

You can export any of the reports in PDF, Excel, CSV.

## Individual employee report#

If you’d like to get data for a single employee make sure to use filters in the reports. This way you can select a particular user and only get their hours in the report.

## Customize reports#

If Clockify’s built-in reports don’t provide the structure you need, simply export the Detailed report as CSV and you can createany kind of reportyou want using pivot tables in Excel/Google Sheets.

## Employees’ hours in Timesheet#

If you’re on the paid subscription plan, you will be able to see employees’ timesheets and add time for them directly from the Timesheets page.

This is very similar to the Weekly report if you filter it by a specific employee and group it by Project.

You can even use the printing option in your browser (or shortcut Ctrl/Cmd+P) then select the optionSave as PDFto save the Timesheet on your computer and print it if necessary.

## Current work and tracked time#

You can see all currently active timers of your employees in your dashboard. Simply select the Team dashboard and check the Last Activity section for In progress timers.

The Dashboard is also the place where you can check who did not track time in a particular date range. Simply select the date range you need and sort the Total Tracked column in ascending order. All users with 0 h did not track time in that particular date range.

This is a good way to check if your employees’ met their weekly/monthly quota of hours.

Another way to see who hasn’t tracked any time is to go to Weekly reports, group it by User, and clickShow users without time. The main benefit of this method is that you can for example filter by approval status and see who doesn’t have any approved time in a given week.

## Below or above target notification#

You can settargets and remindersfor your employees (e.g. 8h/day). Then, if someone forgets to log their time, Clockify will send them an email reminder to fill their timesheets.

Or, if someone tracks too much time and is over their target, admins and managers can receive an email about it.

## Tracked time not visible in reports#

Sometimes employees claim they have tracked time, but somehow you can’t seem to find it in your reports. This happens when employees track time in a different workspace.

When users create a Clockify account they usually get their own personal workspace (unless they’ve signed up to Clockify via the invitation link). So sometimes users mistakenly track time in their personal workspace rather than the one they’ve been invited to by their managers.

If you’re struggling to see your employees’ hours, make sure to check if they tracked time in the correct workspace.


# [ARTICLE] Cost rate
https://clockify.me/help/reports/labor-cost

In this article

- Define cost rates
- Costs and profit in reports

In addition to billable rates, you can also define cost rates and see what you charge clients vs what you pay your team, and track profitability.

Cost rate is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace to Pro or Enterprise plan.

## Define cost rates#

In order to see and define cost rates, you first have to enable cost rates in workspace settings.

Cost rates work the same way asbillable hourly ratesand you can define them right next to billable rates.

Difference between billable and cost rates:

- Cost rates are always applied, whether entry is billable or not
- Cost rates can be set to 0,adjusted per project or user

## Costs and profit in reports#

When you run a report, you can choose whether you wish to see:

- Billable amount– what you charge clients
- Cost amount– what you pay your team
- Profit– the difference between billable and cost (can be negative if costs are greater than income)

This lets you track and compare costs and profit across dates, projects, and users in total (viaSummary report), as well as see profit and cost for each individual time entry (viaDetailed report).

Exports follow what you’re seeing in the interface. For example, you can setShow costin a report, export PDF, and send it to payroll; or you can set “Show amount”, export PDF, and send it to clients.

If you’re exporting a report in CSV or Excel:

- Show amountwill give youBillable amountandBillable ratefor each entry
- Show costwill give youCost amountandCost ratefor each entry
- Show profitwill give you everything:Billable amount,Billable rate,Cost amount,Cost rate,Profit amount, andProfit rate(calculated difference between the two rates)


# [ARTICLE] Approve time & expenses
https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/approval

In this article

- Approve time
- Approve expenses
- Reject submitted request
- Bulk approve/reject
- Notifications

This article describes the process by which Admins and Managers review and approve tracked time entries and expenses submitted by team members. This way, time and budget spent on a project can be precisely estimated and allocated.

Approvingtracked timeis available on Standard and higher subscription plans and can be performed by workspace Admins, Project managers or Team managers.Approvingtracked expensesis available on PRO and higher subscription plans and can be performed by workspace Admins, Project managers or Team managers.

Imagine you are a project manager overseeing a team of developers working on a project for a client. Users working on a project submit tracked expenses during project-related activities, such as software licenses or travel expenses. As the project manager, you review these submissions to make sure they align with project and task budgets and client agreements. Once approved, these entries are integrated into project reports and invoices, providing clients with the billing information.

Depending on the permissions defined in theWorkspace settings, submitted time & expenses can be managed from theApprovalspage in the following way:

- Admin: approve, reject, edit
- Team manager (if enabled): approve, reject, edit
- Project manager (if enabled): approve, reject

To modify these permissions:

- Navigate to theWorkspacesettings>Permissionstab
- In theWho can approve submitted timesheets and expensessection choose:Admins and team managers*Team members can approve timesheets and expenses submitted by their team membersAdmins & project managers*Project managers can approve timesheets and expenses submitted by members assigned to the projects they manage.*Admins can approve time for everyone.
- Admins and team managers*Team members can approve timesheets and expenses submitted by their team members
- Admins & project managers*Project managers can approve timesheets and expenses submitted by members assigned to the projects they manage.*Admins can approve time for everyone.

If a user has Admin and any other manager role, Admin role will override every other role. If a user has both Project and Team manager roles, they will have a union of permissions that combine both of these roles.

## Approve time#

Each time approval request contains the following information:

- Author of the submitted request
- Time of the submitted request
- Status:Unsubmitted/RejectedPendingApproved
- Unsubmitted/Rejected
- Pending
- Approved

Whenever there’s a timesheet that’s waiting for approval, you’ll see an orange dot as an indicator in the sidebar.

Pendingtab

- Save changes

Once a person hasTeam or Project managerrole, they can see theApprovalpage in the sidebar with members/project visible to them.

## Approve expenses#

As is the case with approving time, if there is some expense waiting for approval, you’ll see an orange dot as an indicator in the sidebar.

If you’d like to submit the Expenses approval in theApprovalspage:

- Navigate to theApprovalspage
- Click theUnsubmittedtab

Here’s the list of all the unsubmitted expense approvals with the member’s name, total time, number of approved time off hours and total amount of expenses all grouped based on the time period. If you expand one and click on the unsubmitted expenses, you’ll be redirected to theTimesheetpage with all the time entries that can be submitted.

To continue the process:

- Click theSUBMIT FOR APPROVAL
- Confirmation screen appears
- ClickSUBMITto confirm the action

Once the expense has been approved, it cannot be edited in any way.

### Edit pending expenses#

- Go to theDetailed reportand manually correct the mistake (only as Owner/Admin, or their Team manager)

Once you approve time, time entries are permanently locked. Even Admins can’t make any edits.

If you invoice time after approval and want to mark what’s been invoiced, you can import approved time entries into aninvoiceand approved time entries will automatically get an invoiced tag so you can see what’s been invoiced and filter reports by status.

If the start and end time include an overnight period, there will be a superscript number next to the end time, showing how many additional days the time entry covers.

## Bulk approve/reject#

In Clockify, you can approve multiple pending timesheets and expenses from theApprovalpage.

## Notifications#

- User’s manager is notified if Timesheet is submitted
- User who submitted the timesheet is notified if Timesheet is approved
- User receives an email and note if Timesheet is rejected
- User and all the Admins receive an email if Approval is withdrawn

If you’re Admin and want to receive an email notification when a user submits their timesheet, you need to have aManagerrole for users you manage. This means that, for certain users, you’ll be:

- Admin and Team manager
- Admin and Project manager
- Team and Project manager
- Admin, Team and Project manager

In these cases, user role permissions encompass all permissions defined within that specific role.

You can send email reminders to both users to submit their unsubmitted timesheets, and managers to approve their team members’ timesheets.

### Time tracking#

It is possible to track your time in Clockify Android app in two different ways, either by using a timer or adding time manually.

Clockify groups similar time entries under one expandable entry.

If you wish to see entries in chronological order, go toProfile settings>Preferencesin the web app and turn offGroup similar time entries.

Autocomplete

There’s an autocomplete option available when you tap on an entry and start typing a description.

### Timer mode#

- Install the Clockify JIRA app
- Track time

Our free JIRA app enables you to track time on issues directly from Atlassian JIRA with just one click.

Clockify plugin for JIRA is available in the JIRA web app, JIRA mobile app for Android and iOS, as well as JIRA macOS desktop app.

## Install the Clockify JIRA app#

To start tracking the time, you’ll need to install the Clockify app in JIRA.

- At the bottom of this page click theGeneratebutton to generate your API key
- Copy your key to the API key field in your JIRA issue

Once you enter the key, you will not be asked for it again. However, if you, at some point, generate a new API key for your Clockify account, you will need to update it to match the one in JIRA as well, by resetting it.

### Regional server hosting#

If you’re using regional server, follow the instructions below to successfully integrate Clockify with JIRA.

JIRACloud+Clockify on Regional Server

After you turn onEnable development mode, depending on the region you’re hosting your data in, you need to insert one of the following JSON files in theUpload URLfield:

https://jira.euw2.clockify.me– UK (United Kingdom)

https://jira.apse2.clockify.me– AU (Australia)

## Track time#

When you click on the Clockify timer button you will be able to choose between the Timer and Manual mode you can use to track your time.

### Timer mode#

Make sure you’re in the Timer tab and then start the timer. When you are done, click theStopbutton and your time entry will be recorded.

If you have multiple workspaces in Clockify, you can select the desired workspace before starting the timer in JIRA.

The timer is synced to your Clockify account across all devices and can be stopped in JIRA or from any of the Clockify apps (browser, mobile, or desktop).

If you start tracking time in another JIRA issue without stopping the previous timer, the timer on the first issue will be automatically stopped and saved, and a new timer on the second issue will start.

### Manual mode#

If you forgot to start the timer, or you prefer to fill in all your work hours in one go, you can use manual mode.

Make sure you’re in the Manual tab and then enter the time you have worked on the time entry. When you are done, click the Add time button and your time entry will be recorded.

If you have multiple workspaces in Clockify, you can select the desired workspace before adding the time entry.

Please note that the current limitation for projects shown in the Project picker on Plug-in is 790.

### What gets recorded in Clockify#

When the timer starts, Clockify will automatically pick up the issue title, task, project, and label (tag) from JIRA if the corresponding project, task, etc. already exists in Clockify.

If there is no corresponding JIRA project, task, or tag in Clockify, the integration can automatically create it in Clockify. To make this possible, a user must have permission to create projects, tasks, and tags in Clockify. These permissions can be set in the Workspace settings.

- Description –Clockify will pick up the JIRA issue key number and issue title as a time entry description.
- Project –your project in JIRA will be picked up as a Project in Clockify.
- Task –the JIRA issue key where you started the timer will be picked up as a task (subproject) in Clockify. You can manually change the task you are working on directly from JIRA by clicking on the task name and selecting the one you want from the dropdown.Tracking time on a Child issue in JIRA will be picked up as a task in Clockify with a tagSubtask.
- Tags– correspond to issue types (bug/task/story) and labels in JIRA. You can add more tags to your time entry directly from JIRA.

Information about an Epic or a Sprint will not be recorded, however, if you track time directly on an Epic in JIRA it will create a time entry in Clockify with a tagEpic.

In order for the integration to pick up the right project/task/tag, it either has to already exist in Clockify, or you need to set the right permissions in Clockify’s Workspace settings and make sure all users can create new projects/tasks/tags.

### Work log#

When you stop the timer, the entry will be saved in Clockify and a time log will be created in the JIRA work log (time spent field). Work log shows a timeline of each time entry recorded by everyone for that issue.

If you edit/delete a time log entry from JIRA work log, note that this will not be synced with Clockify, meaning that a time entry in Clockify will not be updated/deleted. Likewise, if you edit/delete a time entry in Clockify, it will not be reflected in JIRA.

Only time entriesstopped in JIRA issuesare going to be added to the work log.

# [ARTICLE] Schedule report
https://clockify.me/help/reports/scheduled-reports

In this article

- Steps to schedule report
- Receive scheduled reports via email

Receive custom reports by email each day, week, or month.

When you filter and share some report, you can also specify for it to be sent by email to you or anyone else in your account so they always receive the latest tracked information for that or previous day, week, or month.

Only Owner and Admins can create Scheduled reports.

Scheduled reports is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace to Pro or Enterprise plan.

## Steps to schedule report#

To schedule a report:

- Go to any report
- Apply necessary filters you wish the report to have (e.g. filter by user, client, etc.)
- Choose a relative date range (e.g. This Week, Last Month, etc.)
- Click Share icon
- Name a report (this name will be used in emails, on the page of the report, and in exports)
- Choose recipients
- Choose how often you wish to receive the report (daily, weekly, or monthly)
- ClickCreate link

Reports with custom date ranges can’t be scheduled and only admins can schedule reports.

You can see all your scheduled reports on the Shared reports page. Reports that are sent to email will have thescheduledtag next to them.

You can turn scheduling on/off for existing shared reports from the Shared reports page, by clicking on the three dots next to to a report.

Admins can choose for the report to be sent only to themselves, or select other users in their Clockify workspace.

## Receive scheduled reports via email#

- Dailyemails are sent each day according to the recipient’sDay startsetting inProfile settings
- Weeklyemails are sent at the beginning of each week according to the recipient’s Week start in Workspace settings and Day start setting in Profile settings
- Monthlyemail are sent each 1st of the month, and according to the recipient’sDay startsetting in Profile settings

### Email content#

- Name of the report
- Exact dates for which the report is sent
- The total tracked time and breaks and how much of it is billable (as calculated at the moment the email is sent). If you don’t want the email to display billable time, make sureDon’t show amountis selected before you share the report.
- The link to thelive time reportfor more information (always shows the relative range you’ve saved)
- Direct links to download the report as PDF, CSV, and Excel (download will be for the dates from the email)

If there’s a new total because you’ve added or edited existing timesheets, the email will contain outdated information, but the link will display the current information.

If you’ve locked the dates in the report, the download links from the email will respect the locked dates (e.g. if you’ve savedYesterdayand locked the date, each earlier email will point you to the same download, i.e. yesterday).

### Email reports to people outside Clockify#

If you wish others to receive a scheduled report, you’ll need to set up email forwarding.

You’ll need to create a filter in your email client for emails that contain the subject you need, and then create a rule for those emails to be forwarded to another email.

For example, you can filter a report by client, name the reportClientX Weekly Reportand schedule it to be sent once a week, and then create a filter and rule for those email to be sent automatically from your inbox to the client’s email address.

Include all required columnsYour CSV file must contain all therequired columnsfor your workspace and that the column headers are named correctly.

Use English headersAll CSV column headers must be inEnglishand exactly match the names you set in workspace settings, even if you are using the app in a different language.

## Start import#

To start the import process:

- Go to theSettingsand choose theImporttab
- Drag & drop a CSV file, or upload it from your computer

After that, you’ll complete two steps to make sure your data is accurate.

### Step 1: Inspect data#

After you upload your file, a preview will appear. Here, you can review the data and correct any issues before you proceed.

Error detection

Rows and errors are automatically highlighted. Use theOnly show rows with errorsoption to quickly filter the list and see what needs to be fixed.

Fix errors & reupload

Clockify automatically detects common delimiters (commas and semicolons). If a column name is not recognized, it will be marked with a warning and that data won’t be imported.If you find errors you need to fix, you can make changes to your file outside Clockify and reupload it directly from this step.

Timesheet-specific checks

If you are importing Timesheet data, you need to confirm thedate formatused in your file.You will also be notified if you are importingTimesheetdata for users who are not yet in your workspace, allowing you to add them first.

### Step 2: Import summary#

Once you’ve reviewed your data and clickedImport, the progress bar will show the import status. The import will continue in the background if you leave the page.When it’s complete, a summary will be displayed with a link to your newly-imported data in Clockify.

### Check time and date formats

The formats used in your CSV file must exactly match the formats set in your Clockify account.

| Format | Where to check settings | Mismatch example |
| Time (12-hour / 24-hour) | Profile Settings | If your CSV has 1:00 PM, but your settings use 24-hour time, the import will fail. |
| Duration (hh:mm:ss, etc.) | Workspace Settings | Your CSV duration format (e.g. 1:30) doesn’t match the format set in your workspace. |
| Date (DD/MM/YYYY, etc.) | Profile Settings | Your CSV date format doesn’t match the one set in your profile. |

### Max character limits#

- Description: 3,000
- Task: 1,000
- Project: 250
- Client: 100
- Tag: 100

## Important to note#

- Required fields for time import: Email, Start date, Start time, Duration
- Optional fields for time import: Billable, Description, Project, Task, Client, Tag (if somerequired fieldis enabled, it is required in CSV too)
- If you don’t group projects by client, you should rename the client column in the CSV file accordingly
- End date and end time are calculated automatically based on start time and duration
- Time entries are imported according to the time zone of the person who does the import
- If you don’t specify an entry’s billable status, it will be inherited from its project
- Hourly rates are inheritedaccording to the hierarchy

- Export settings
- Branded reports

Flexibility and customization are crucial when it comes to managing your assets effectively. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the ways of customizing CSV, Excel and PDF exports for your time & expense tracking reports. By customizing your exports you can focus on the specific data you need in a format that suits your requirements.

This is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace to any of our paid plans.

By customizing a report export, you choose which columns you want to get in the CSV, Excel or PDF formats.

## Export settings#

To configure the export settings:

- Go to a report
- ClickExport
- ChooseCustomize
- Choose information you wish to get when you export CSV/Excel/PDF
- Save

Each report you export from now on, will contain only the selected data.

This customization works on a per-user basis, and is saved across sessions. If you decide you need a certain column, you can always turn it back on.

You can add custom text at the footer of the PDF report by checking theNotesoption and entering text. All PDF exports for that type of report will have that text until you disable the note.

You can also get a separate column for each user’s group in CSV/Excel once you enableGroupin the Detailed report’s export settings.

## Branded reports#

Export the PDF reports with your company logo.

Simply upload your company logo in yourWorkspace settingsand your logo will be included in each PDF you export, andCreated with Clockifywill no longer appear in the PDF footer.

Branded reports is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace to any of the paid plans.

https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/gps-tracking

In this article

- Data gathering and privacy
- View location
- Delete location
- Location accuracy

Whenever your team is on the road or on site, they can clock in via their mobile app and you can see their location on the map.

With GPS tracking, you can see who’s currently working on site and everyone’s location history throughout the day while they were on the clock.

GPS tracking is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace toProorEnterpriseplan.

## Data gathering and privacy#

Location can’t be tracked without user’s knowledge and permission. In order to record the location:

- Admin has to enableActivate GPS trackingin workspace settings.
- All workspace members will get a notification when location recording is enabled via a web and a mobile notification
- User has to download and track time via themobile app(iOS or Android).
- User has to enableLocation serviceson their mobile phone.
- User has to allow the Clockify app to access their location.
- Each regular user can see all their recorded locations. Admin sees all recorded locations in the workspace.
- Location is recordedevery time timer is started and stopped in the mobile app. Also, while the timer is running, more locations will be recorded if the user moves significantly (usually more than 500m) – this varies depending on your device (its operating system, version, settings, and granted permissions).
- Locations are collected even if the mobile app works in the background.
- Each location is tied to a time entry. If the time entry is deleted, its locations are deleted, as well. Along with that, if youundo the ‘delete’ action, entry’s location will be restored as well.
- Admins can delete anyone’s location. Regular users can delete their own location.
- You can view locations for the past 7 days. All locations older than 7 days are deleted forever automatically.

## View location#

To view recorded locations, click on Activity in the sidebar, and then the Locations tab.

Admins can view everyone’s recorded location, while regular users can see only their own.

You can see current locations of your staff, their routes, and time stamps of when the location was recorded.

On the right side, you can see all active users in your workspace, plus their last recorded location on the map for that day as well as the timestamp when it was recorded. If a user doesn’t have any location that day, you’ll see just a hyphen (-).

If a user has a redrecordingdot next to them, it means they still have the timer running at that location.

To see a user’s all recorded locations in the day, click on them in the sidebar. You’ll get a list of all the records, plus you’ll be able to see their route on the map (based on recorded locations that day).

To close the detailed view and get back to the team overview, click on X next to the user’s name.

To see locations for other days, click on < or > in the upper right corner next to the date (you can go back up to past 7 days).

## Delete location#

Both admins and regular users can delete recorded locations.

You can delete recorded locations on the web version of Clockify, when you go to Activity > Locations from the sidebar.

If you’re admin, click on a user on the right to enter their route view, hover over the location you wish to delete, and click on the trash icon.

If you’re a regular user, just hover over the record you wish to delete and click on the trash icon.

All locations older than 7 days are deleted forever automatically.

There is no undo when a location is deleted (each delete is permanent and non-retrievable.).

If a user deletes their account, all their location data is deleted too.

## Location accuracy#

GPS location tracking is not 100% accurate due various facts (phone’s operating system, version, model, closed vs open space, geographic factors like tallness of buildings, etc.).

Location accuracy can be:

- High accuracy – Real location can be off by less than 150m (500ft)
- Medium accuracy – Real location is off by 150-500m (500-1,600ft)
- Low accuracy – Real location is off by 500-1,000m (1,600-3,200ft)

When the recorded location has medium or low accuracy, you’ll get an indicator in the person’s detailed route view.

If the location accuracy is off by more than 1,000m (3,200ft), it won’t be recorded.

- Filter invoices
- Sort by time entry or expense details
- Additional invoice settings
- Set up translations

Create invoices for clients based on tracked time and mark entries as invoiced, so you don’t double bill clients.

Invoicing is a paid feature, which you can use if youupgradeyour workspace to Standard, Pro, or Enterprise plan.

For step-by-step guidance on how to create and manage invoices in Clockify, watch the video and follow the instructions below.

Invoicing needs to be enabled in theWorkspace settings.

## Create invoices#

To create invoices:

- Go to theInvoicespage

- Set taxation mode

There are also some actions you can do such as to duplicate the existing invoice and quickly create a new one.

- Choose the invoice you’d like to duplicate
- Click on the three dots menu
- Choose theDuplicateoption from the dropdown

This newly-created invoice contains the same information as the original one. This information can be changed and edited according to your needs. Any imported time entries won’t carry over their dependency.

Bill from,name,addressand logo are taken from yourWorkspace settings, andBill to addressis taken from the client.

To edit client address:

- Go to theClientspage
- Choose client
- Click the edit icon and edit their address

Expand your contact list in the settings on theInvoicespage. Once you add more contacts, they’ll appear in theBill fromthe dropdown on any invoice.

Admins can access the Invoices page. You can allow specific members to also see and manage in workspace settings under the Who can manage invoices section.

### Set up recurring invoices#

UseRecurring invoicesto automate invoices that repeat at custom intervals, such as weekly or monthly and save time and minimize errors along the way.

This feature is available to users on the STANDARD and higher subscription plans and can only be applied to newly-created invoices.

Recurring invoice settings

You can manage all settings for recurring invoices and stop the automation process whenever necessary.

Set up recurring invoices

To set up a recurring invoice:

- Navigate to theInvoicespage
- Click thethree-dot menunext to the invoice you want to set as recurring

All users with permissions to manage invoices will receive notifications when a recurring invoice is generated.

You’ll receive anemailcontaining the invoice ID, client name and a link to review the invoice.

Anotificationpopup will also appear in the app with a link to the invoice preview.

If you archive a client who has a recurring invoice set up, a notification will appear to confirm that the recurring process for that client will be stopped.

If you don’t want to receive notifications, you can uncheck that option in your email settings.

### Reminders if invoice is past due#

Stay informed about your outstanding payments by sending reminders via email and in-app notifications when an invoice is past due. This way, you can manage all your payments on time.

This feature is available on STANDARD and higher subscription plans.

How it works

You’ll be notified about your overdue invoices via email and in-app notifications.Every day you’ll receive an email listing all the invoices that are past due for that given day.You’ll also receive a separate in-app notification for each overdue invoice.

All reminders contain a direct link (Review invoice) to an overdue invoice for quick access.

Manage reminders

Admins and invoice managers can configure these reminders in the settings and turn them on or off.

All users that can manage the invoice will get the notification.

Email notification preference

To manage all emailnotifications related to invoicing, go to theEmail notificationtab in yourPreferencespage.

## Edit invoice#

To edit an invoice:

- Go to the invoice you’d like to edit
- Choose an action from theActionsdropdown in the upper right corner
- Choose one of the following actions:See all your invoicesFilter invoices by statusMark invoices asSent,Paid,VoidEdit, delete, change status of an invoiceDownload expenses
- See all your invoices
- Filter invoices by status
- Mark invoices asSent,Paid,Void
- Edit, delete, change status of an invoice
- Download expenses

### Record payment#

Record payment option saves the invoice payment.

To record invoice payment:

- Choose theRecord paymentoption
- Record paymentscreen appearsDate: Enter today’s dateAmount: Enter unpaid invoice amount you’d like to mark asPaidOptionally changeDate,Amountor add aNote
- Date: Enter today’s date
- Amount: Enter unpaid invoice amount you’d like to mark asPaid
- Optionally changeDate,Amountor add aNote

ClickSaveto complete the action.

As a result, invoice is marked as:

- Paid(you entered full amount)
- Partially paid: (you entered amount smaller than invoice amount)

Amount is displayed in currency assigned to the client.

#### Payments window#

When an invoice is marked asPaid, you’ll see thePaymentsoption in the three-dot menu. This will open a list of all recorded payments for that invoice.

ThePaymentswindow includes the following details:

- Date: The payment date
- Author: The person who made the payment
- Amount: The total amount paid
- Note: An optional field where you can add a note

#### Invoice status#

- Invoice withPartially paid,Fully paidandVoidstatus cannot be edited; In order to be edited, paid invoices need to be marked as eitherUnsentorSent
- If invoice status isPartially paid, you can see all previously invoiced payments
- If record payment amount is negative number or zero, invoice can be immediately marked asPaid
- If due date for sent invoice passes, invoice gets anOverduestatus
- If status is changed toUnsent, all previously processed payments are deleted

All other invoices need to be processed through theRecord paymentoption.

### Manually configure invoices#

Clockify allows you to manually mark time entries and expenses as invoiced/uninvoiced. This way you have complete control over the invoicing workflow, accurate time and expense tracking without duplicated invoices errors.

To manually mark time as invoiced:

- Go to theDetailed report
- Choose all time entries you need viaBulk edit
- Click onMark as invoiced(next to Bulk edit in table header)

Invoiced time entries have a greenInvoicedtag next to them in theDetailed report.

When you hover over theInvoicedtag, you’ll see the client and the invoice ID under which the time entry was invoiced (unless it was manually marked as invoiced).

By default, each new invoiceID is automatically assigned a unique number in sequence, such as invoice1, invoice2, invoice3, and so on, thanks to the auto-increment feature.

To mark time as uninvoiced:

- Choose only invoiced time entries
- ClickMark as uninvoiced

### Conversion from clock to decimal format#

Total amount between reports and invoices may slightly differ.

Invoices round time on two decimals, while reports take more decimals into account.

For example:You have a time entry whose duration is 20min, or 0.3333333h when converted to decimal format. When a report multiplies it with hourly rate of $100, the result in the report is $33.33. But when that entry is imported into an invoice, the invoice imports time rounded to two decimals (0.33h), which when multiplied with $100 equals $33.00.

Grouping option may also result in different total amounts.

For example:You have three entries on some project, each 20min. If you import time one by one with the Group hours: Detailed option, the invoice will make three line items of 0.33 and total amount will be $99.00 (3 x 0.33h x $100). But if you choose Group hours: Project option, they will be summed up and rounded using more decimals (like in the reports), resulting in $100.00 invoice.

To avoid discrepancy due to the decimal rounding, round time up, down, or to nearest number 6/12/15/30 minutes (i.e. any number divisible by six).

## Filter invoices#

You can filter invoices by:

- Status
- Issue date
- Client
- ID
- Bill from contact
- Amount

To filter invoices:

- Go to theInvoicespage
- Choose filter criteria at the top of theInvoicespage:Date rangeClickApply filterClientStatusAmountBalanceInvoice ID
- Date range
- ClickApply filter
- Client
- Status
- Amount
- Balance
- Invoice ID

All invoices will be filtered out according to the selected criteria.

## Sort by time entry or expense details#

When you create a new invoice or edit the existing one and import time and expenses, you can choose to display them according to the details in theDetailed view.

To display entries and expenses inDetailed view:

- Choose the invoice on theInvoicespage
- Click onImport time and expensesat the bottom of the page
- ChooseDetailedinDisplay timedropdown

InShow in invoicelabel choose the tag by checking the box and rearrange them by drag & drop. The checkbox you chose will appear in the Item’s description.

Same behavior is applied forExpense detailsandTime entry details.

When different billing rates are applied, entries are always displayed in multiple lines, overriding the single-line option.

## Additional invoice settings#

You can get invoices in another language or name things differently (e.g. change label from Tax to VAT):

- Go to theInvoicespage
- Click on thecog icon(settings) next to theCreate invoicebutton
- In theDefaults tab, edit the content you’d like to be displayed in each label

After the changes you’ve made, each PDF you generate will display the new labels.When you create a new invoice, it can inherit some predefined subject, note, issue date, and tax.

To set defaults:

- Go toInvoicespage
- Click on thecog icon(Settings) on theInvoicespages
- Make the necessary changes in theDefaultstab

Customize invoices exported inPDFfrom theAppearancetab in theInvoice Settings. Here, you have the option to hideQuantityandUnit Pricecolumns, as well as toggle text direction from left-to-right or right-to-left.Enable detailed invoicing by including TAX and TAX2 columns in your PDF exports simply by checking the provided boxes.

### Existing invoices#

When the user clicks on theInvoicestab and enters any of the invoices, after theAmountcolumn, there should be two columns. TAX and TAX 2 depending on whether you applied one or two taxes on your invoices.

Paid and partially paid invoices cannot be edited and the checkboxes are disabled, as well.

### Download invoices in PDF#

You can choose which columns should be visible in the downloaded PDF file. You can customize the PDF in theInvoice settings>Appearance taband choose if you’d like to include TAX and TAX 2.

Depending on which items you checked, those columns will be displayed in the PDF file.

TAX and TAX 2 are system names which can be changed for the download file in the Invoices, Translation tab, where TAX and TAX 2 are input fields.

For more information on invoice taxes, check outthisarticle.

## Set up translations#

With translations, you can customize labels on your invoices, from item types to total amounts due.

Translations will appear on the PDF and printed versions of all your invoices.

- Click on thecog icon(Settings) next to theCreate invoicebutton on theInvoicespage
- Choose theTranslationstab

In this article

- Data gathering and privacy
- Record screenshots
- View screenshots
- Delete screenshots

Generate screenshots from your desktop app, while the timer is running.

Download for Windows →

Download for Mac →

Windows and Mac desktop apps have integrated screenshots.

Screenshots is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace to Pro or Enterprise plan.

## Data gathering and privacy#

Screenshots can’t be recorded without user’s knowledge.In order to record screenshots:

- Admin has to enable “Activate screenshot capturing” in workspace settings
- All workspace members will receive a notification when screenshot capturing is enabled via both the web and the desktop app
- Screenshots are taken only while the timer is running (regardless of where you started the timer) AND if you have the screenshot recording app installed
- Screenshots are low-resolution and blurred for privacy and security reasons, by default. However, admins and owners can set a higher resolution on a workspace level.
- Each regular user can see all their screenshots. Admin sees all screenshots in the workspace
- Each screenshot is tied to a time entry. If the time entry is deleted, its screenshots are also deleted.
- If a user deletes a screenshot, the time between the previous and current screenshot will be subtracted from the total time
- You can go back and see the screenshots up to a year from the moment they were created. All screenshots older than one year are automatically deleted forever.

Clockify can also:

- Record which apps you use and websites you visit usingauto tracker, but that data is completely private (data is not available to workspace admins).
- Detect when you’re inactive usingidle detection(no mouse movement or keystrokes), but that data is shown only once when you become active again, so you can decide if you wish to keep, or exclude idle time (information is not available to workspace admins).

## Record screenshots#

To capture screenshots, you need to install the desktop app for Mac or Windows.

Once installed, you’ll need to log in and start the timer.

Screenshots are captured randomly in 5-minute intervals while the timer is running and the desktop app is active.For instance, if we take a look at 20 minutes of tracked time, within those 20 minutes, there are four 5-minute intervals.Let’s say that the timer is started at 12:15. The first five-minute interval is 12:15-12:20. The first screenshot, is taken after five minutes, at the end of this first interval, at 12:20.All other screenshots are taken 3-8 minutes after the interval started.

Screenshots won’t be taken if the duration of a time entry is less than 5 minutes, or if the timer is running on the web or mobile, but not on the desktop app (or you’re not logged in).

When Mac prompts you, you have to allow Clockify to take screenshots. If you click Deny, you’ll have to go toSystem Preferences>Security & Privacy>Screen Recordingand check Clockify app.

## View screenshots#

When screenshots are enabled, all users in the workspace will see the Activity > Screenshots page in the sidebar.

Regular users can see all their personal screenshots, and admins can see everyone’s.

All active users in the workspace are listed, and next to each person you can see a total number of recorded screenshots in that day.

If a person has screenshots, you can click on their name, or the expand icon in the right corner to see the screenshots, time when each was recorded, as well as the name of a project, task and client, if available.

You can click on a screenshot to open a gallery view, and then go back and forth between the screenshots.

To see screenshots for other days, click on < or > in the upper right corner next to the date (you can go back up to one year from the time when the screenshot was taken).

## Delete screenshots#

Admins can delete anyone’s screenshots.Regular users can delete only their own screenshots, unless the time entry is locked or approved. Only Admin can delete locked or approved time entries.

To delete a screenshot:

- Hover over a screenshot you want to delete
- Click on a trash icon
- In the confirmation screen, clickDeleteto complete the action

### Important considerations#

After you delete a screenshot of:

- Time entry that’sapproved, time entry remains
- Time entry that’snot approved, time entry is deleted

Also note that:

- Admins can delete screenshots for everyone without the subtraction of the time entry’s total time.
- After a regular user deletes a screenshot, the time between that and the screenshot before it will be subtracted from the time entry’s total time. If an entry has only one screenshot, a whole time entry will be deleted.
- If a time entry with a screenshot is deleted by users or admin, all the screenshots related to that entry are automatically deleted.
- If user deletes their account, all their screenshots are also deleted.
- Screenshots older than a year are automatically deleted forever.

To delete a screenshot that was captured from a currently running timer, you first need to stop the timer, and then you can delete a desired screenshot.

There is noundoaction when a screenshot is deleted. Each deletion is permanent and non-retrievable.

### Offline mode#

In the offline mode, screenshots are collected by the app and stored locally. Once the app goes back online, the screenshots are sent to the server and stored there.

https://clockify.me/help/projects/project-budget

In this article

- Define project budget
- Recurring estimates
- Estimates in reports
- Permissions

If you have fixed fee projects, you can track their progress and see how much of the budget was spent by setting estimates in monetary terms. You’ll also get alerts when you’re about to go over budget.

Project budget is a paid feature you can enable byupgradingyour workspace to Pro or Enterprise plan.

## Define project budget#

To set project budget:

- Go to theProjectspage
- Choose project and click on project’sSettingstab
- InProject estimatesection, selectProject budgetYou can set an overall project budget using theManualoptionOr, you can chooseTask-basedand then define budget for each individual task on the project (the project’s overall progress will always be the sum of all its task budgets).
- You can set an overall project budget using theManualoption
- Or, you can chooseTask-basedand then define budget for each individual task on the project (the project’s overall progress will always be the sum of all its task budgets).

When project budget is selected, project’s status tab and its progress bar will reflect the billable amount of each entry on the project vs the budget, and show you how much was spent and how much remains.

You can also choose to include billable expenses as part of project budget by enablingBudget includes billable expenses.

Alertsalways consider project status, and will be sent no matter if the project estimate is defined in time or budget.

## Recurring estimates#

If you have projects that have different budgets over different time periods, you can set theBudget (or Estimate) resetsafter the time period you set in the project’s Settings tab located below the estimate section.

Project estimate can be reset for one of these three periods:

- Week (Monday is default week day)
- Month (default time period, 1st of the month is default day)
- Year (January is default month, 1st of the month is default day, 00:00 is default hour)

To set the estimate reset on a weekly/monthly/yearly basis:

- Go toProjectspage in sidebar
- ChooseSettingstab
- Navigate toProject estimatesection
- Turn theReset estimate every <period> on the <date> at <time>switch on

Now, when estimate resets after each <week/month/year>, on each <date> at each <time>, the progress bar for the project will return to 0%.

This action can be performed by admins and owners and is available to project managers for the projects they are assigned to whenWho can see hourly rates and amountsis set toAnyone.

After you set the estimate period, it is applied to all previous time periods. Also, only time entries that belong to the currently set time period will be displayed in theTracked vs Estimatedsection of theproject status.Alerts also take into consideration the reset option.

Time format in the estimate is the one set in theProfile settings.

If estimate reset is turned on:

- Info about currency per time is defined in theProject estimate
- Reset period is specified on project and displayed when you hover over one project
- WithTask-based estimate type,Time estimate,Project budget,Tracked,Amount,StatusandProgressare also reset
- Change is applied toAlertsandAudit log

## Estimates in reports#

Only admins can see, share, and download estimates in reports.

To see estimates and budget for each project and task in the report:

- Open theSummary report
- TurnShow estimateon

Estimates and budget for each project and task are displayed next to tracked time.

You can also download the report with estimates via export, or share the estimate numbers when you share a report.

Exported files will have estimates only if the level of grouping is eitherProjectorTask, or both. Also, keep in mind that theShow estimateswitch needs to be turned on.

## Permissions#

Who can see budget depends on the permissions set in theWho can see hourly ratesand amountsandWho can see project statusin the Workspace settings.

If set to Admins:

- Only Admins can see and set project budget on all projects

See all your tracked time in a Calendar view so you can:

- See how your day looks like at glance and notice work patterns
- See if you have gaps in day where you forgot to log time
- See if you double booked time and have overlapping entries

## View time#

Your each time entry will appear as a time block in the Calendar’s time slots.

Current day is marked as blue in the table header, and current time is indicated by the blue horizontal line.

Each time slot represents 1h, but you can zoom in using the plus sign in the upper left corner all the way down to 30/15/5 minute blocks.

You can hover over a time block to see full entry details, or click on the block to open the full view of the time entry.

Change the first day of the week in yourProfile settings. This way, the week start that you set here will override the default one set by Owner/Admin in theWorkspace settings.

## View team member’s calendar#

Admins and Team Managers can view other users’ calendars. This option is available withAdd time for otherspaid feature.

To view a user’s calendar:

- Click on the Teammates picker at the top of the Calendar page
- Select a user from the list

Admins can select any active user in the workspace and Team Managers only users they manage.

If you are an admin, you can edit or add time for a team member directly in the calendar. This option is available if you update your workspace to any of our paid plans.

## Add and edit time#

You can edit time entries directly within the Calendar:

- Drag the start/end time edges of the time block to shorten/extend the entry
- Drag and drop the whole time block to move it to some other time slot (or date)
- Click on time entry tosplitrunning of already created entry

You can also add new time entries directly within the Calendar:

- Click on any open time slot to add a time entry
- Click and drag up or down to create a time entry for the desired time slot

Hold a left mouse click on a block to quickly make a copy of a time entry and drag and drop it to a desired time slot.

Please note that, if the start and end time include an overnight period, there will be a superscript number next to the end time, showing how many additional days the time entry covers.

If you are an admin, you can stop someone’s timer as well as edit/add time for a team member directly in the calendar. This option is available if you update your workspace to any of our paid plans.

## Show working days only#

If you’d like to focus only on your workdays in your Calendar’s week view, theShow working days onlyswitcher allows you to do that.

Every user, regardless of their user role can adjust their own Calendar settings.

### Turn on Show working days only#

This setting is off by default.

To turn it on:

- Click on theSettings iconon yourCalendarpage
- In theCalendar settingswindow, find theShow working days onlyoption
- Turn the switch on
- ClickCloseto exit the screen

Once turned on, your Calendar’sWeekview will only display the days defined as working days in your workspace settings (or on yourTeampage profile). If you’re viewing another user’s calendar with this setting on, you’ll see their defined working days.

This setting doesn’t change the Day view, which always shows all days.

If the switch is turned on, and the user is looking at the non-working day in the calendar, by clicking on the week, they can see the working week of that day.

### Turning off Show working days only#

To see all days again in your Calendar view:

- Open theCalendar settingsby clicking the Settings icon
- Turn theShow working days onlyswitch off
- ClickCloseto exit the screen

If you’re currently viewing a non-working day with the switch on, simply click on the week to jump to the working week of that day.

## Connect to Google Calendar or Outlook#

Clockify can display events from Google Calendar or Outlook (Office 365), so you can compare side-by-side how you planned your day vs how it actually looked like (i.e. what you tracked), and create time entries based on calendar events.

To connect Google Calendar or Outlook:

- Go to the Calendar page
- Click on the settings icon (next to Teammates)
- ClickConnectfor Google Calendar or Outlook
- Authorize Clockify to access your calendar’s events

Once the calendar is connected, you’ll see all your events from Google Calendar or Outlook right inside Clockify in a new column.

If you make changes in the external calendar, those changes will reflect in Clockify. Events from your connected calendar are only displayed in Clockify.

All-Dayevents will not be shown. Only events with a start and end time are shown.

When you click on the event in Clockify, you can:

- Start a timer for that event
- Create a time entry from the event
- Open the event directly in the external calendar

Each user needs to personally connect their calendar. Only you can see events from your connected calendar (admins and managers can’t see events from your connected calendar).

The data Clockify collects includes: event name, start and end time, and link to the event. Clockify has View-only access to the calendar (it can’t edit events).

Only cloud Outlook is supported (on-premise and hybrid versions are not supported at the moment).

## Work with multiple calendars#

If you have multiple calendars, you can choose which ones you wish to see in Clockify.

If you wish to see events from other calendar accounts, you’ll need to add those calendars to your Google or Outlook account, and then they’ll get listed in the Clockify’s connect window, where you can enable them:

- Adding calendar from another account (Google Calendar)
- Adding calendar from another account (Outlook Calendar)

## Disconnect Google Calendar or Outlook#

To disconnect the calendar, click on the connect button and then on the three dots, and you’ll see the Disconnect option.

You can also revoke Clockify’s access to Outlook by going to Outlook account > Manage your apps > Clockify > Remove permissions.

You can also revoke Clockify’s access to Google Calendar by going to your Google account > Security > Apps with access to your account > Remove access.


# [ARTICLE] QuickBooks
https://clockify.me/help/integrations/tracking-integrations-integrations/quickbooks-integration

In this article

- Connect QuickBooks Online
- Set up Clockify for the first time
- Data mapping
- Send time to QuickBooks
- Disconnect QuickBooks Online

Connect Clockify to your QuickBooks Online account and send time entries.

QuickBooks integration is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace to Clockify’s Standard, Pro, or Enterprise plan and QuickBooks’ Essentials, Plus, or Advanced plan.

Integration supportsQuickBooks Online (Essentials or Plus plan).Doesn’t work with QuickBooks Desktop or QuickBooks Online Simple Start plan.

If you have Payroll feature enabled in QuickBooks, Clockify integration won’t work due to system’s capabilities.

## Connect QuickBooks Online#

- Log in to your Clockify account
- Go to thethree dotsmenu next to the workspace name
- ChooseWorkspace settings, thenIntegrationstab
- Expand QuickBooks section and clickConnect to QuickBooks
- Authorize Clockify to access QuickBooks (you’ll need to be logged in to QuickBooks)
- Sync Clockify with QuickBooks
- Create missing users from Clockify and missing customers from QuickBooks

Before connecting to QuickBooks, make sure you have invited all users in Clockify, they have accepted the invite, and their names in Clockify (inProfile settings) and QuickBooks (their display name) are the same.

If you don’t have any projects in Clockify, everything will be pulled from QuickBooks so you don’t have to create anything manually.

If you add new user in Clockify, or new customer in QuickBooks, you’ll have to perform the sync again manually in the Integrations tabs before trying to send time to QuickBooks (Clockify won’t make any changes to your QuickBooks account unless you do it explicitly).

Please note that if you can’t sync certain time entries, you should check the settings on the QuickBooks side and whetherClose the Booksoption is turned on for that year.

If you want to connect just one or several specific projects(e.g. to test the integration):

- Create a project with the same name as the customer (or project) in QuickBooks
- Create employee(s) in QuickBooks with same name as they have in Clockify
- Connect Clockify with QuickBooks
- After you’ve connected, DON’T create missing users and project (at this point, users and projects between Clockify and QuickBooks with the same name are connected to each other)
- Go to Detailed report,filterthe report by the project/user you need, and send to QuickBooks

## Set up Clockify for the first time#

- Invite team members to track time
- Make sure their names in Clockify and QuickBooks are the same
- Connect QuickBooks with Clockify
- Sync users and customers (this will create a project in Clockify for each QuickBooks project/customer)
- Track time on projects in Clockify
- Send tracked time to QuickBooks using Detailed report

## Data mapping#

- User Name in ClockifyandEmployee Display Name in QuickBookshave to be identical in order to sync
- If user doesn’t exist in QuickBooks as an employee, you’ll perform sync in Settings > Integrations > QuickBooks
- Project Name in ClockifyandCustomer (or Project) Name in QuickBookshave to be identical in order to sync
- If you have parent customers in QuickBooks,Sub-customerin QuickBooks will be treated asProjectin Clockify and itsParentin QuickBooks will be treated asClientin Clockify
- If a project doesn’t exist in QuickBooks as a customer (or project), you’ll first have to create it manually in QuickBooks using the exact same name as in Clockify, and perform sync in Settings > Integrations > QuickBooks

Also, keep in mind that QuickBooks has a robust structure with the hierarchy going up to four levels in depth:

- QuickBooks Customer ———> Clockify ClientQuickBooks Sub-customer 1————> Clockify Client and Project (same name)QuickBooks Sub-customer 2 ———–> Clockify Client and Project (same name)QuickBooks Sub-customer 3 ————> Clockify Project
- QuickBooks Sub-customer 1————> Clockify Client and Project (same name)QuickBooks Sub-customer 2 ———–> Clockify Client and Project (same name)QuickBooks Sub-customer 3 ————> Clockify Project
- QuickBooks Sub-customer 2 ———–> Clockify Client and Project (same name)QuickBooks Sub-customer 3 ————> Clockify Project
- QuickBooks Sub-customer 3 ————> Clockify Project

This means that you can have customers that are both, aParentcustomer and aChildcustomer (Sub-customer) at the same time (e.g. Sub-customer 2). In that case, when mapping it into Clockify, it will be mapped both, as aClient(since it’s aParentof Sub-customer 3) and aProject(since it’s aChildof Sub-customer 1) with the same name.

QuickBooks also has aProjectin their system. Depending on its position in the hierarchy, QuickBooks Project can be mapped either as Project or Client in Clockify as presented in the scheme above.

## Send time to QuickBooks#

Once you’ve connected Clockify and QuickBooks, and synced users and customers/projects, you’ll see the QuickBooks button in theDetailed report.

- Go to the Detailed report
- Click QuickBooks button to see all time entries that haven’t been sent to QuickBooks
- Review if you wish to send all the data you see and apply filters if necessary
- ClickSend to QuickBooks

Clockify sends the following information to QuickBooks:

- User
- Description
- Project
- Date
- Duration
- Billable status
- Billable rate

Once all the entries have been sent successfully, the system will mark them as sent. To see time entries that have been sent, click on the QuickBooks dropdown (next toShowing not sent entries), and chooseShow sent entries.

Once an entry has been sent, it can’t be sent again. If you make changes to an entry, the change won’t be reflected in QuickBooks (meaning you’ll have to manually update time in QuickBooks too). To avoid this, it’s best to send onlyapproved timeto QuickBooks.

Notes

- It’s not possible to send billable entry without a project to QuickBooks
- If you turn rounding ON, Clockify will send rounded values
- Only Admins can send time to QuickBooks
- Individual time entries longer than 23h55m won’t be sent
- Clockify sends user’s name, date, project (i.e. customer in QB), billable status, hourly rate (if billable), duration, description
- Clockify also sends time entries of inactive and deleted users that were previously synced

## Disconnect QuickBooks Online#

To disconnect your QuickBooks account:

- Log in to your Clockify account
- Go to thethree dotsmenu next to the workspace name
- ChooseWorkspace settings, thenIntegrationstab
- Expand QuickBooks section and clickDisconnect
- Confirm the action

Once you’ve disconnected QuickBooks, you’ll no longer see the QuickBooks button in Detailed report and Clockify won’t have access to your QuickBooks account.

You can reconnect to QuickBooks on the same page by clickingConnect to QuickBooks.

https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/auto-tracker

In this article

- Download and installation
- Enable auto tracker
- Data and privacy
- What is tracked
- Create time entries from activities
- Hide added items

Auto tracker lets you automatically monitor programs that are active while you’re tracking time. This feature helps you generate accurate timesheets based on the time you spent on different tasks.

## Download and installation#

Auto tracker is available for these platforms:

Download Windows appDownload Linux appDownload Mac app

For macOS users: Make sure you installed the Mac app from the Clockify website. The version downloaded from the Mac App Store doesn’t include the Auto tracker.

## Enable auto tracker#

After the desktop app is installed and you are logged in:

1. Click theA iconlocated at the top of the application window2. Click theStart Recordingbutton on the pop-up window

The auto tracker is now active and will begin monitoring your computer activity.

By default, the auto tracker only records activities (programs or websites) you view for more than 10 seconds. Any activity shorter than this threshold will not be recorded.

This rule is to prevent clutter from quick window switches. You can adjust or override this time limit within the auto tracker’s settings.

To do this, open the Clockify desktop app.

1. Click on the three-dot icon2. SelectPreferences3. Go toAuto tracker4. Set your preferred duration (in seconds) next to the optionTrack only apps that are active for longer than.

The default duration upon installation are as follows:

- Windows – 15 seconds
- MacOS – 60 seconds
- Linux – 15 seconds

## Data and privacy#

It’s important to understand how this feature tracks your data. Here’s how auto tracking works:

| Feature | Details |
| Storage location | All recorded data is stored locally on your computer. |
| Privacy | Only the person using the app can see recorded activities and add them as time entries |
| Automatic deletion | Data older than 45 days is automatically and permanently deleted from your local storage |

If a regular user didn’t add activities as time entries, admins won’t be able to see them.

## What is tracked#

Auto tracker creates a new record every time you switch to a different application, browser tab, or document. Here is the data it captures:

- Programs and window titles:The names of the applications and documents you are using.
- Website URLs:Visited website URLs are tracked by default. (This feature can be disabled in the auto tracker settings if you prefer more privacy).
- Idle time:TheIdlecolumn shows the percentage of time you were inactive (no mouse or keyboard movement) within that recorded activity block.

## Create time entries from activities#

Recorded activities only appear in the auto tracker window and aren’t automatically added to your timesheet. You must manually convert them into time entries.

1. Click theAicon2. Click the plus (+) sign next to the activity3. Add a project and a description for the task4. ClickSave5. Close the auto tracker windowYou should now see the added time entry on the main page.

You can select multiple items by clicking on one item, then holding down theShiftkey and selecting more items. Right click and do one of the following:

- Add Selected– All selected items will be added as separate time entries
- Merge Selected– All selected items will be merged to create one time entry
- Delete Selected– All selected items will be deleted

## Hide added items#

You can modify your auto tracker settings to hide activities added to your timesheet.

1. Click on the three-dot icon on your Clockify desktop app2. SelectPreferences3. Go toAuto Tracker4. Enable the optionHide added items from Auto Tracker


# [ARTICLE] Duration format
https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/duration-format

In this article

- How duration formats are implemented
- Set up duration format

Efficient time tracking is at Clockify’s core, and we understand that different users prefer different ways of representing duration. With preferred duration format, you can see, enter, and export time in format that suits your needs.

Clockify has three different duration formats:

- Full (hh:mm:ss)
- Compact (h:mm)
- Decimal (h.hh)

## How duration formats are implemented#

- Full: ‘2’ = 2 minutes
- Compact: ‘2’ = 2 minutes
- Decimal: ‘2’ = 2 hours
- All formats:‘2h’ = 2 hours‘2m’ = 2 minutes
- ‘2h’ = 2 hours
- ‘2m’ = 2 minutes
- Full format only:‘2s’ = 2 seconds; other formats show 0:00 for less than 1 minute‘120s’ = 2 minutes
- ‘2s’ = 2 seconds; other formats show 0:00 for less than 1 minute
- ‘120s’ = 2 minutes

Decimal duration format (e.g. 2.5 hours) would be ideal for a freelancer who is invoicing clients based on hourly rates. This format simplifies the billing process and is useful to those who need time entries in a numeric form.

Decimal format is a paid feature you can enable byupgradingyour workspace to any of our paid plans.

## Set up duration format#

To set up duration format on your workspace:

- Navigate to the workspace name
- Open the menu
- ChooseWorkspace settingsfrom the dropdown
- Find duration format in theGeneraltab
- Choose one from the dropdown

Once you selected duration format:

- That duration format is displayed everywhere in the interface (tracker, timesheet, reports, invoices etc.)
- Duration in PDF/Excel and CSV report exports is in that format
- Cells in all duration inputs interpret time in that format (e.g. if you type 1, it is considered to be 1h)


# [ARTICLE] Audit log
https://clockify.me/help/administration/audit-log

In this article

- Enable audit log
- Run audit
- Filter logs
- Previous and new value of 'update' events

Record every activity within your workspace and get a comprehensive record of actions, users that initiated them and timestamps for easy reference later on.

Audit log is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace to the ENTERPRISE plan.

## Enable audit log#

To start recording actions:

- Open the menu next to the workspace name
- ChooseWorkspace settings
- Activate audit log
- Select change you wish to record (change to time entries, projects, clients, tags)

For example, if you check time entries, you’ll get a record in audit log whenever someone creates a new time entry, edits their existing entry, or deletes it.

Audit log also records cascade changes. For example, if you have a time entry on some project, and that project is updated (e.g. it’s renamed or deleted), you’ll get a record log for bothProject updatedand forTime entry updated. This only happens if you record both changes in workspace settings. For example, if you record changes to time entries but not to projects, you won’t get a record in audit log when a project is updated.

## Run audit#

- Open the menu next to the workspace name
- ChooseWorkspace settings>Audittab
- Choose date
- Choose author
- Choose actions
- ClickRun report

Once you get the report, you can review events in the table (timestamp, author, and action), and expand for more details.

You can also export audit log as a CSV file and analyze it in Excel or some other program.

Because audit log files can be huge, it takes a while to generate them. You can wait and download it once it’s finished, or you can choose to receive it via email within half an hour.

Audit logs older than 1 year are automatically deleted (due to their enormous size). We recommend exporting them each month and storing them personally for archive purposes.

## Filter logs#

You can filter audit log by:

### Actions#

Actions dropdown contains a list of actions grouped by entity type: time entry, project, task, client, tag, expenses.

| TIME ENTRY | PROJECT | TASK | CLIENT | TAG | EXPENSES |
| Created time (personal, timer) | Created project | Created task | Created client | Created tag | Created expense (personal) |
| Created time (personal, manual) | Created project (import) | Created task (import) | Created client (import) | Created tag (import) | Created expense (for other) |
| Created time (import) | Created project (QuickBooks) | Updated task (personal) | Created client (QuickBooks) | Updated tag | Restored expense (personal) |
| Created time (kiosk) | Updated project | Updated task (for other) | Updated client | Deleted tag | Restored expense (for other) |
| Created time (for other) | Deleted project | Deleted task | Deleted client | | Updated expense (personal) |
| Restored time (personal) | | | | | Updated expense (for other) |
| Restored time (for other) | | | | | Deleted expense (personal) |
| Updated time (personal) | | | | | Deleted expense (for other) |
| Updated time (for other) | | | | | |
| Deleted time (personal) | | | | | |
| Deleted time (for other) | | | | | |

### Authors (users)#

Authors are all active or archived workspace users.CheckSystemif you’d like to see activities logged by the app.

### Date#

Filter logs by date. Open date picker and choose date range.

Maximum date range is 30 days.

## Previous and new value of ‘update’ events#

‘Update’ events in Audit log contain more details about what has been updated on your workspace (e.g. project name change, setting up billable rate, added estimate…). Once you expand the event on the Audit log page in the report you run, you’ll get more information about the ‘update’ event in question.

We recommend enabling Audit log from the moment you start using Clockify. This way, you will always have previous and new value of all your ‘update’ events. If you use Clockify and enable Audit log for some object later, you might not have access to the previous value because it wasn’t recording events at that moment.

For example, if you create a time entry while audit log is off, and you later enable it and you update the same entry, audit log will show that it’s been updated but you won’t be able to compare the previous and new value. However, if you update that entry again, audit log will show both the previous edit as previous value and what exactly has been updated in the new value.


# [ARTICLE] Create & manage time off policy
https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/create-manage-time-off-policy

In this article

- Create and manage policies
- Archive policies

Manage holidays, vacations, and other types of leave, and track accrual and balances.

Time off is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace to Standard, Pro, or Enterprise plan.

## Create and manage policies#

Before anyone can request time off, you first need to enable Time off in Workspace Settings and define a time off policy.

- Open the three-dots menu at the top left
- ChooseWorkspace settings
- Scroll down to theTime offsection
- Enable time off
- Choose ifRegular users can see Time off outside their teams(optional)

To access all your policies and create new ones:

- Open theTime offpage from the sidebar
- Click on theSettingsicon
- Choose if you’d like to manage or create holiday or time off policies

You can have multiple policies, one for each type of employee.

Each policy has several fields that affects only that policy:

- Assignee– only team members you add to the policy will be able to request time off for it
- Time unit– you can track time off and balance in days (like vacation) or hours (like banked hours i.e. time off in lieu)
- Requires approval– your team members can submit time off requests, which managers or specific members can approve (admins can approve time off for everyone). If left unchecked, all requests are automatically approved when submitted.
- Balance expiry:Never expires(default) – Balance for this policy won’t have a start or end date and won’t expire.Has expiry dates– Accrual and every balance for this policy need to have a startand end date defined.
- Never expires(default) – Balance for this policy won’t have a start or end date and won’t expire.
- Has expiry dates– Accrual and every balance for this policy need to have a startand end date defined.
- Automatically accrues– when enabled, all active policy members will automatically receive a set number of days or hours on their balance, complete with a set start and expiry date. Clockify sends notification when an accrual period is changed or expires.
- Start/end date– defined timeframe during which defined balance can be used
- Allow negative balance– if checked, team members can request time off even if they don’t have enough available days/hours (e.g. for Sick leave). You can also limit the number of allowed negative balance.
- Limit to number of days per period of time– set a limit to a number of days a user can request per defined period
- Reset negative balance– if enabled, Clockify will reset negative balance at the end of the year to automatically clear all negative time off and return the balance to 0 at the end of each yearKeep in mind that new days added to a balance will not automatically clear a negative balance. They will simply be added to the total amount available.Any “leftover” amount will appear as a separate negative balance.
- Allow half day– if time off policy is calculated in days, you can let people ask for a half-day leave, choose the first or second half of a day off, even across multiple days
- Hours– if time off policy is calculated in hours, you can let people ask for multiple hours off across multiple days
- Automatically create time entries– automatically create time off and holiday entries and track approved time off requests and holidays with the project you choose

### Manage time off balance#

Clockify also allows you to manage when and how time off balances can be used by your team members.

Set policy expiration

You can define if the balance for a specific time off policyexpiresornever expires. This setting affects all users under that policy.

- Go toTime offpage and openManage policiesinSettings
- ClickEditnext to the policy you want to change
- Go to theBalance expirysection and choose one of two options:Never expires(default)Balance doesn’t have expiry dateHas expiry datesAll future accruals and balances for this policy require definedstartandenddate
- Never expires(default)Balance doesn’t have expiry date
- Has expiry datesAll future accruals and balances for this policy require definedstartandenddate

Important to note:

- If you switch policy toNever expires, all existing start and end dates on user balances will be removed
- If you switch policy toHas expiry dates, all existing balances get a start date of today and all future balances will require a start and end date

### Manage user’s balance#

Owners and admins can apply a specific validity period (start and end date) to any user’s balance. This makes sure that users request time off during a specific timeframe. Once the period ends, the balance will expire and be automatically removed.

To add or edit user’s balance:

- Go to theTime offpage and open theBalancetab
- Choose policy at the top of the pageIf you’d like the page to display information based on users, chooseUserat the dropdown
- ClickManage balancefrom the three-dots menu next to the user’s name
- InManage balancepopup:– Enter number of days added to balance– Define timeframe for the balance to be valid– Optionally add notes
- ClickAddto save changes

You can also click Add next to a user’s name in the list to open the same popup.

When a user requests time off, Clockify always deducts days from the balance that is expiring the soonest.

#### Bulk add balances#

You can add balances to multiple users on a single policy at once.

To do that:

- Go to theTime offpage and open theBalancetab
- Check the box next to each team member you want to edit, or clickTeam member
- It will select all the members listed
- ClickAdd to balance
- Enter number of days and timeframe and clickAddto complete the process

#### Balance history and notifications#

You can view a user’s balance history for a specific policy by selectingHistoryfrom the three-dot menu next to their name.

When a user’s balance is updated (either manually or automatically through accrual), they will receive an email with details about the new validity period.

## Archive policies#

You canarchivepolicies that are no longer used (e.g. Vacation 2021).

- Click on the three dots next to the policy
- ChooseArchivefrom the dropdown

You canrestoreordeletethe policies in the same way.

When you archive a policy, all balances and requests remain, but team members can’t choose the archived policy when requesting time off. Deleting a policy deletes all the requests and balances for that policy.

- Approve expenses
- Submit expenses for approval
- Invoice expenses

Record project and task-related expenses via web or mobile app, and include them in invoices. You can also use expenses to record fixed fees (e.g. day rates, retainers, overtime pay, reimbursements, salaries, etc.), and expenses that are unit-based (e.g. hours, mileage, days, materials, etc.).

Expenses is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace to Pro or Enterprise plan.

To use Expenses, you first need to enable that functionality in theWorkspace settings.

For an overall guidance on how to add Expenses in Clockify, watch the video and follow the instructions below.

## Add expenses#

- Choose date, project/task (optional), and category
- Enter amount (or unit)
- Enter note with more information (optional)
- Upload receipt (optional)
- ClickSave

For expenses that have unit, users enter unit (e.g. miles) and the total amount is automatically calculated based on that category’s amount per unit.

Note that:

- Each expense inherits billable status from its project/task, which you can change on per expense basis
- Each expense inheritscurrency assigned to client
- You can edit existing expenses by clicking on the three dots next to the expense
- You can delete expenses from the three dots menu and immediately undo the action from the success toast message

For more information, check out theExpense reportarticle.

## Approve expenses#

Added expenses appear in theExpensespage.

For expenses to be approved, an Admin or a Team/Project manager need to perform this action on theApprovalspage. Prior to approving, expenses need to be submitted first.

## Submit expenses for approval#

Added expenses appear in theExpensespage. Now, expenses can be submitted for approval by Owner/Admin/Team manager and subsequently approved by Owner/Admin/Team/Project manager.

For more information, check out how toSubmit expenses for approval.

## Invoice expenses#

- ClickImport time and expenses
- Select date and projects
- EnableInclude billable expenses
- Choose how you wish expenses to be displayed (display each expense as a new line item, or group them by project, user, or category)
- Clickimport

Only billable uninvoiced expenses are imported into invoice.

If an expense has unit, unit column will take the unit from the expense and the price column will take price from the category. Expenses that don’t have a unit will be displayed as one unit.

Imported time will be displayed asServiceitem type, and expenses asProductitem type. You can customize name of item types in invoice settings, as well as hide the item type column from PDF.

Each imported expense will be marked as invoiced so you don’t accidentally invoice same expense twice. If you remove a line item that contains imported expenses (or delete the whole invoice), those expenses will be marked as uninvoiced.

In this article

- Full vs limited member
- Creating limited members
- Paying for limited users
- Managing limited members
- Converting limited members to full members
- What you can do with limited member

Limited members are users that don’t have an email and can only clock in via akiosk. On the other hand, users that have an email and can log into Clockify on their own are considered full users.

You can use limited members to:

- Add historical time data for people who are no longer in the company
- Allow employees without an email to clock in and clock out viashared kiosk

## Full vs limited member#

| Full member | Limited member |
| Has name and email | Has only name |
| Can log into Clockify and use apps (web, mobile, desktop) | Can use only kiosk |
| Can switch tasks and projects, and record location | Limited by kiosk |
| Takes up a full seat (from $3.99/seat) | Takes up a limited seat (from $0.79/seat) |

## Creating limited members#

- Make sure you havekioskenabled in workspace settings
- Go to theTeampage in the sidebar
- Choose theLimitedtab
- ClickAdd limited members
- EnterEmployee name(one employee per line)
- ClickAdd

If you’re on a FREE plan, you can have an unlimited number of limited members.

If you’re on a paid plan, you need to have a limited seat for each limited member (active).

If an account with that email address already exists, it won’t be possible to create an account for a limited user.

## Paying for limited users#

If you’re on a paid plan, limited members are charged separately from full users.

Each active limited member requires one limited seat and the price depends on your current plan.

You can buy limited seats on your Subscription page, or directly when adding a member on the Team page.

Added limited members are immediately active upon being added. If you deactivate a limited user, another limited user can take their limited seat.

If user edits their email address in any way, Clockify will treat it as a new email for a new account. User won’t be able to access this account until they change the email address in the profile settings.

## Managing limited members#

Limited members’ profiles can be managed on all plans by Admins, who can:

- Edit their profile
- Edit their kioskPIN
- Deactivate their account

## Converting limited members to full members#

Limited members can only clock in via kiosk you set up. They can’t use mobile app on their own or access Clockify via web.

If you wish people to personally log in, track time via a mobile or web app, approve timesheets, manage members, and run reports – they need to be a full member.

To convert a limited member to a full member:

- Navigate to theTeampage
- Open the three dots menu next to the member’s profile
- ChooseAdd emailfrom the dropdown menu
- Enter the email address of the person
- ClickAddto complete the process

Once converted, the person will receive an invitation email, which they need to confirm and then access Clockify.

If you’re on a paid plan, you’ll need to have an available full seat to convert a member. Once you convert a limited member, the full member seat will become filled and a limited seat will become available.

## What you can do with limited member#

- Limited members can be assigned to kiosks
- Limited members can be added to groups
- Limited members can be given assignments and added to Schedule
- Admins can submit their time for approval
- Admins can create expenses for them
- Admins can request time off for them
- Admins and Team Managers can see their activity in Team Dashboard
- Admins and Team Managers can see, filter, and export their time in Reports
- Admins and Team Managers can categorize their time (e.g. add or change project and task)
- Admins and Team Managers can add and edit their time in Timesheet, Calendar, and Detailed Report


# [ARTICLE] Track breaks on kiosk
https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/breaks-kiosk

In this article

- Start break
- Finish break
- Reports for breaks

Breaks on kiosk allow employees to specify when they’re on a break via akiosk. They can start or end their breaks using your kiosk terminal. Later, in reports, admins and managers can see when each employee was on a break and for how long.

Breaks are apaid feature, which you can enable by upgrading your account to any paid plan.

Breaks can be enabled by admins in the Workspace settings.

## Start break#

To start a break:

- Go to kiosk
- Select your profile
- Enter your PIN (if required) or scan QR code
- ChooseStart break

If you’re clocked-in and start a break, you’ll be automatically clocked-out and a timer for break entry will start immediately.

People who are on a break will have an orange dot next to them on the kiosk list.

TeamDashboardalso shows who’s currently clocked-in and who’s on a break in the web app.

## Finish break#

To finish a break:

- Go to kiosk
- Select your profile
- Enter your PIN (if required) or scan QR code
- ChooseFinish break

When you finish a break, you’ll be automatically clocked-in again. A break timer will end and a new clock-in timer will start.

## Reports for breaks#

You can distinguish break entries from regular work entries:

- On the Timer Tracker, Detailed report, and Approval, a break entry will have a gray “Break” tag
- In the Calendar, a break entry will have a coffee cup icon on it
- In the Timesheet, a new line shows all breaks summarized

You can define to which project/task break time will be tracked in the kiosk settings:

- Go toKioskpage
- Clickthree dotsnext to some kiosk
- Choose a default project/task for break
- Save kiosk and all break time will be tracked to the selected project/task

Please note that you can change the default project/task break for one or multiple kiosks, if you’re a member of multiple kiosks. If you click a continue icon on a break entry (via Time Tracker or Calendar), a timer for a new break entry will start running.

Users on allpaid planscan create multiple kiosks.

On the Timesheet, you can edit breaks, or copy them from previous week or via template.

In the Detailed report and Time Tracker, break entries can be edited in the same way as other time entries. You can also include them in invoices if they’re billable.

You can filter reports by break and non-break status in the Status filter.

You can see break status of each entry in the Detailed report export (Excel, CSV).

It’s not possible to remove the break tag from an entry.

If you need to manually create a break entry, duplicate an existing one and modify its information (e.g. start/end time, user, etc.). If you duplicate it while the Break feature is disabled, a regular entry will be created instead.

If you’re no longer on a paid plan, Break feature will be disabled, but time entries for break made by that point will remain visible, but not editable.

https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/pin

In this article

- Clock in via QR code
- Clock in via PIN
- Manage PINs and QR codes
- PIN code requirements

With Clockify, you can clock in to a kiosk using either a QR code or a PIN.

Workspace admins choose which authentication method is used in theWorkspace settings.

To set up the authentication method for kiosk:

- OpenWorkspace settings>Generaltab
- Choose the authentication method:QR codeorPIN(4- or 6-digit)

## Clock in via QR code#

QR codes make clocking in fast and secure for both limited and regular users.

QR code authentication method is available onStandardand higher subscription plans.

Before you start, enable QR authentication in theWorkspace settings.

To clock in via QR code:

- Open the kiosk app
- Open the QR code you received by email
- After scanning, you’re automatically logged in and can clock in/out

## Clock in via PIN#

PINs allow quick access without searching for your name onkiosk.

Logging in with PIN is apaid feature, that you can enable by upgrading your account to any paid plan.

There are two types of PINs used to authenticate kiosk members:

- 4-digit PIN
- 6-digit PIN (more secure and provides more unique combinations)

Admin can enforce either option at the workspace level. When enforced, all kiosks use that same PIN type.

To clock in via PIN:

- Open the Kiosk
- Enter your 4-digit or 6-digit PIN
- Clock in

After 3 failed login attempts, you should contact your manager, since you won’t be able to log in to the kiosk by yourself.

### Fallback options#

If QR scanning fails, you can clock in using your 6-digit PIN.Each kiosk has aUniversal PINfor clocking in any non-admin user.

Admin can see and download all QR codes and PINs, even if kiosks are offline. They can switch authentication methods anytime.

### Personal vs Universal PIN#

Each kiosk has aUniversal PINthat allows you to clock in and out for any employee (exceptowner/admin)e.g. Give this PIN to a shift manager so that can clock in for a team if needed.

Each employee, upon becoming a member, automatically gets their ownpersonalPIN code.

To clock in, an employee simply selects their profile on the kiosk and enters their personal PIN.

If you know kiosk’sUniversal PIN, you can enter it instead of a personal PIN to clock in for any employee.

AUniversal PINcannot be used to sign in with owner/admin role. They must always use their personal PIN code.

- Any PIN code can’t have the same four/six digits (e.g. 111111).

### Also important to note:#

- Admins can generate new PINs for users
- Admins cannot manually edit an employee’s PIN
- If you disable/re-enable a kiosk, existing PINs stay the same
- If you switch authentication method, you get a new PIN for the new method
- Switching back restores your previous PIN for that method


# [ARTICLE] User fields
https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/user-fields

In this article

- Create user fields
- Apply user fields
- Edit and delete user fields
- User fields in reports

User fields allow you to add additional information about team members (like job title, start date, position, phone, department, employee ID), and later export it along with time entries.

This is a paid feature and it is available for users ofProandEnterpriseplans.

## Create user fields#

To create a user field, go toWorkspace Settings>Custom Fieldstab, scroll down to theUser custom fieldssection, and clickCreate.

First, you need to specify the field type based on the type of information you’d like to add about the user.

- Text– input field for any type of information (e.g. Employee ID, Location, Start Date)
- Number– input field for numerical values (e.g. Internal ID)
- Link– input field that accepts URL to websites or files (e.g. Certificate, Profile Link)
- Switch– a simple yes/no switch (e.g. Part-Time)
- Select– input field that lets users select a single option from a pre-determined list (e.g. Department)
- Select multiple– input field that lets users select any number of values from a pre-determined list (e.g. Eligibility)

Fill in name, description, placeholder, and select values (if any).

Once you create a field, drag it to the Active column so it becomes visible in user profiles.

The maximum number of the created user fields is 50 and the maximum number of active user fields is 10.

## Apply user fields#

After the user field has been created and activated, go toTeampage and click on three dots next to some user.

When you scroll down, you’ll see the user field you have created and you can set the value for that user.

User fields values can be entered byOwnersandAdmins.

## Edit and delete user fields#

If there is a value defined for the user field, after that field is drag & dropped into theActive fieldscolumn, that value is transmitted to all the users in the Team (active, inactive and invited)

If, at some point, the default value of theActive user fieldchanges, then this new value is applied only to new users (the default value for the existing users doesn’t change).

User fields can be drag & dropped back and forth betweenAvailable fieldsandActive fields.

Deleting a user field deletes that field and all its data of all members, across the whole workspace. Once you delete a field, it’s like it never existed. You cannot revert this action.

To retain data, it’s best to deactivate a custom field by moving the field to theAvailable column.

## User fields in reports#

When a user has some user field filled out, you can get its value when exporting reports along with that user’s time entries.

To get user fields in CSV and Excel, you’ll need to enable them first:

- Go toDetailed report
- Click onExportand chooseCustomize
- Check what fields you wish to get in export
- Save Export settings
- Export CSV or Excel

You can filter reports by any user field by clicking on the dropdown arrow next to Filter, and checking the user field filter (only active fields are shown). Then, select by what value you wish to filter and clickApply filter.

If deactivated, the kiosk URL stops working and employees can’t clock in.

If deleted, the URL disappears and entires lose kiosk-metadata (time entries stay, but kiosk info is removed).

Kiosks stay open for 24h by default. After that, admin must relaunch them. For longer sessions or multiple devices, a paid plan is required.

If you’re on a STANDARD plan and you’ve uploaded thecompany’s logoin the Workspace settings, your logo is displayed on your kiosk.

### Close kiosk#

Closing a kiosk doesn’t clock out existing users, so make sure everyone’s clocked out or they won’t be able to stop their timer (admin will have to do it for them in the web app by visiting their Calendar and stopping the timer from their currently running time block).

To close a kiosk:

- Select your admin profile on the kiosk
- Enter your PIN (if required)
- ChooseClose kioskin the lower left corner

- Key concepts
- Manage user seats
- Subscription billing intervals
- Download invoices
- Upgrade
- Downgrade

Discover greater control with Clockify’s paid features.Subscribenow and redefine your time tracking experience. Opt for the subscription plan you like the most, priced per user seat, and transform your workspace into a more advanced environment.

Before you upgrade, make sure you’re logged into your workspace.

Keep in mind that the upgrade cost depends on the number of active team members, regardless of their roles or the features they use.

## Key concepts#

Get familiar with key concepts and processes you might come across when working with upgrades and subscriptions on Clockify.

### Billing & seats#

Please be aware that you will be charged each billing cycle for thetotal numberof user seats you have. So, if you have more user seats than the active users in the workspace, you will be charged forall user seatswhether they are used or not.

You only need to buy a seat for an active user in your workspace. If a user is deactivated, manually remove their seat from theSubscriptionpage. Activated users count as used seats and total number of seats represent the number of seats available in that workspace.

For example:You paid an annual subscription for two user seats. You had two active users for a couple of months and then deactivated one. Now, you have one vacant user seat and you can invite new user that will take up that seat. This means that each time youdeactivatea user, you free up a seat they used to occupy.

### User seats#

Represent the number of active team members you can have in your workspace. When you subscribe to a paid plan for the first time, you must buy a seat for each active user, but you can also buy more seats if you plan on inviting more users in the future.

### Bundle seats#

Represent a number of active members on Clockify, Pumble and Plaky workspaces purchased withBundle subscription planwithinCAKE.comProductivity Suite.

For detailed instructions on how manage Bundle seats, check outBundle seatsarticle.

### Team member#

Team member is everyactive userthat joins or is invited in the workspace regardless of their user role and features they use. Every time a new user joins or is invited to your workspace, they take up one user seat. If there are no available user seats left, you won’t be able to invite users and they won’t be able to join your workspace.

### Full & limited users#

While usingkiosk, you’ll come across two types of users:FullandLimited. Full users refer to team members when the Kiosk feature is enabled, while Limited users are those that have restricted access and can only clock in/out as required.If you’d like toaddLimited users to your workspace, you’ll be charged for that separately.

## Manage user seats#

If you’ve used all available user seats in your workspace, you can add more users by purchasing additional seats on theSubscriptionpage in the app.

Only workspace owners/admins can manage subscriptions and add/remove user seats.

### Clockify Subscription page#

TheSubscriptionpage allows you to manage user seats, have an overview of all your invoices and subscription plans with the option to upgrade/downgrade to the subscription plan that suits your needs.

To accessSubscriptionpage:

- Open the three-dots menu next to the workspace name
- ChooseSubscriptionfrom the dropdown
- You’ll be redirected to theSubscriptionpage

When you land on theSubscriptionpage, you’ll see three tabs:

- Billing
- Invoices
- Plans

Billingtab tracks your current subscription plan, price, used and available user seats and all the features at your disposal available with your subscription plan. It also includes all yourcustomer,invoiceandpayment information.

The progress bar in your current plan tracks the number of used vs purchased user seats. If there are available user seats in the workspace, the bar is blue, if there are no seats left, the bar is red.

Click onView price breakdownto see a detailed overview of all charges related to your subscription, including the subscription fee, number of seats, billing plan type, taxes, and any additional fees. This way you can review the total cost at any time.

Clockify doesn’t provide refunds for removed user seats.

Invoicestab keeps track of all your past invoices and billing statements.

Planstab provides the list of subscription plans and upgrade/downgrade options.

For more information, check outPayment process.

To remove aBundle seat, get in touch with oursupport team.

#### Unpaid invoice#

If you have an unpaid invoice, and would like to add more user seats, you will be informed that you first need to pay the invoice in order to proceed.

Click on theCheck unpaid invoicesbutton and you’ll open theInvoicestab in a new window, where you can review and pay the invoice.

## Subscription billing intervals#

You can submit your payments periodically:

- Annually
- Monthly

If you opt for the annual billing period, you get 20% off.

### Switch billing intervals#

In theSubscriptionpage, you can switch between two billing periods (monthly/annual) at any time.

- Annual to monthly: You’ll switch to monthly subscription plan after your current annual subscription ends
- Monthly to annual: You’ll be immediately charged a prorated price (annual price minus the remaining calculation from your current plan)

If you switch from your phone or tablet and you don’t see the link in theSubscriptionpage, go to theUpgradepage and you’ll see the annual billing link next to monthly.

Please note when buying seats that all the prices areprorate.

For more information, check outSubscription plans.

You need to settle any unpaid invoices in order to manage workspace subscription.

## Download invoices#

To get all your invoices:

- Open the menu next to the workspace name
- ChooseSubscriptionfrom the dropdown
- Switch to theInvoicestab

There you’ll see all past billing statements where you can download your invoices.

## Upgrade#

If you’re subscribed to a certain subscription plan but realized you need some additional features and would like to upgrade to a higher plan, you can do that on theSubscriptionpage in the following way:

- Navigate to the workspace name at the top left corner of the screen
- Open the menu
- ChooseSubscriptionfrom the dropdown
- Opt for the billing cycle in thePlanstab
- ClickUpgradebeneath the plan you want
- Choose billing period
- Confirm upgrade

When you upgrade, you’ll be immediately charged a prorated price of the new plan for the current billing month.

Upgrading to a higher subscription plan unlocks paid features, but the number of seats remains unchanged.

## Downgrade#

If you realize you don’t need all the additional features you’re using on your subscription plan and would like to downgrade, you can do that by following these steps:

- Navigate to the workspace name at the top left corner of the screen
- Open the menu and chooseSubscriptionfrom the dropdown
- Switch to thePlanstab
- ClickDowngradebelow the plan you’d like to downgrade to
- Confirm the action

Warning banner provides details regarding the downgrade to the plan below. If you choose to downgrade, once your current subscription ends, the new subscription to the lower plan starts. The same logic is applied if you’re switching from the annual to the monthly plan.

In this article

- Step 1 Customer info
- Step 2 Invoice info
- Step 3 Payment info
- Failed payments
- FAQ

This article will walk you through the process of payment when signing up for theClockify subscription plans. You’ll be guided through the flow of the successful payment and also get some tips on what to do if the payment fails.

When you subscribe to a paid plan on Clockify for the first time, you need to complete the following steps:

- Once you logged in, click theUpgradebutton at the top right corner of the page
- You’ll jump to the Plans tab in theSubscriptionpage
- Choose the plan you’d like to subscribe to and thebilling cycle(monthly/annually)
- You’ll see the three steps you need to complete to activate your subscription

## Step 1 Customer info#

In the first step, you need to provide some basic information about you or the organization you represent.

In the Customer type field, choose if you’d like to be registered as:

- Individualor
- Company / Organization

Individualimplies that you, as a self-employed or freelance individual, are subscribing to the app. When filling out the information, country and company names are optional.

Billing and usage details associated with the subscription are linked to you as an individual.

This is suitable if an individual user is using Clockify as a productivity tool.

Selecting forCompany / Organizationindicates that the subscription is intended for a group, company, or collective entity. The billing and subscription details are tied to the organization’s name.

This is useful when Clockify is used as a productivity tool for a team or business, allowing teams within one organization to access and use the app under a single subscription.

Keep in mind that when you opt for aCompany/Organizationas aCustomer typefor the first time, or switch from Individual toCompany/OrganizationCustomer type, you need to choose theCountry(required)you/your organization is based in. Tax policy of the country you choose here will determine the specific fields you’ll see inStep 2.

In case you’d like to switch fromindividualtocompany/organization, you have the option to add the info related to your company.

If you had set Customer type as Company / Organization inStep 1, you cannot switch to Individual after you subscribe. However, you can switch from Individual to Company / Organization Customer type.

The State/Province field may be required based on your selected country.

Only workspace owner can edit information provided in this step.

## Step 2 Invoice info#

Here you should provide us with more details including email and additional details needed to properly invoice subscription payments.The form differs based on the customer type you previously chose.

- Individual:EmailCityPostal code
- Email
- City
- Postal code

Individual customer type

- Company/organization:Company nameEmailAddress (if required*)
- Company name
- Email
- Address (if required*)

*Address in the Invoice info tab isrequiredfor Individual and Company/Organization customer types based in theUSonly.

All prices are shown exclusive of taxes. If VAT applies based on your country’s regulations, it will be added to the final price, which you can review at checkout before completing your payment.

Example of how tax is added to the subscription fee:

Consider a scenario where a company located in the United Kingdom (UK) subscribes to Clockify. Since the UK applies tax to digital services, the subscription fee will include this tax. Now, let’s assume that their monthly subscription fee is $50. When the company proceeds to pay, they will be charged an additional 20% for tax, making the total amount $60 ($50 for subscription fee + $10 for the tax).

In specific cases when the Customer type is Company/Organization with the Country with multiple tax types, you’ll get Tax type and Tax ID fields that you need to fill out.

After you’ve filled out all the necessary information, clickNext stepand proceed to Step 3.

Only workspace owner can edit information provided in this step.

### Tax exemption cases#

Some businesses in the US are eligible for tax exemption, meaning they do not need to pay sales tax on their subscriptions. To validate your tax-exempt status, please email us atbilling@mail.cake.comwith the following information:

- Tax Exemption Certificate addressed to CAKE.com Inc., 2100 Geng Rd STE 210, Palo Alto, CA 94303, USA
- Email address associated with your subscription or the email address of the account owner

We’ll review your submission and apply the tax exemption accordingly.

## Step 3 Payment info#

In this step, you need to enter all payment information including information about your credit card and check ourTerms of Use.

- Enter your credit card information
- ClickFinish paymentYou will be charged and will immediately get access to Clockify’s paid features

Clockify currently supports only payments made by credit card.

Based on country/state selected in theCustomer info, the subscription cost are displayed in one of the currencies:

- USD
- EUR
- CHF

Important to note:

- Payment is tied to your workspace. If you have multiple workspaces, you need to pay a subscription fee for each workspace separately.
- Payment is done securely throughStripe. Clockify doesn’t store any credit card information.
- Your subscription is automatically renewed each month/year. This way, you don’t have to worry about forgetting to renew the subscription and disabling some features in the process (like locking timesheets).
- We generally don’t offer refunds, unless there was a system error. In that case, contact our support atsupport@clockify.meso that we can sort things out.

### Subdomain#

If your workspace is on subdomain and it has an auto-join option enabled, new users can join only if there are available seats.

In case all seats are occupied, users will get a message that there are no available user seats. In case this happens, the owner or admin will receive a message that someone is trying to join their workspace, but that there are no user seats available.

To help you proactively manage your account, Clockify will also notify owner/admins when 90% or more of user seats are used up and provide instructions on how to purchase more.

## Failed payments#

If you have a valid subscription, but your payment failed (e.g. incorrect payment information, insufficient funds, expired credit card), you’ll get atwo-week grace period(payment overdue). During this grace period you can go to yourSubscriptionpage and update your payment information. After that, our payment processor will try to process the payment, again.

If the payment wasn’t processed by the end of the grace period, and the grace period ends, you’ll bedowngradedto afree plan. As a result, you won’t lose your data, only access to paid features.

If your payment has failed, and you’re not sure why, feel free to contact Clockify support atsupport@clockify.me.

## FAQ#

### How to resolve failed payment?#

If your payment fails and you’re unsure of the reason, there are steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.First, verify if3D Secureis enabled for your card. Making sure that3D Secureis activated on your card can help prevent unauthorized transactions and provide added security during online payments.Also, you need to confirm whether your credit card has beenauthorized for online payments. Some credit cards may have restrictions or require prior approval for transactions conducted over the internet. Verifying the authorization status of your credit card can help identify any potential issues that may have led to the payment failure.

### Users with cards issued in India – how RBI regulation affects your subscription?#

As of October, 2021, if you are a holder of a card issued in India, you need to authorize merchants (such as Clockify) to make recurring charges to your card.

Since this regulation came into force, it led to an increased number of failed payments for our users with cards issued in India.

Rest assured that Clockify has done everything to comply with these regulations. This means that you need to authorize Clockify to be able to collect recurring payments. Before your subscription renews, you will receive an email to confirm your payment.

The email is sent to the address you entered in theInvoice informationon yourSubscriptiontab. Simply confirm the payment and everything should be alright from there.

For payments with a recurring charge greater than 5,000 INR (~66 USD), you need to authorize each recurring payment. This means that every time your subscription renews, you need to confirm the payment in the confirmation email you received from Clockify. Only this way will the payment be successful.

### Helpful tips:#

- Make sure you’re using a card that supports AFA (if not, you can change your card by going to thePayment informationsection in theSubscriptionpage
- Check your email to see if you have received an email to authorize the payment
- Contact your bank to confirm and authorize the payment


# [ARTICLE] Single sign-on (SSO)

- Setting up custom subdomain
- Inviting new users
- Configuring SSO
- SAML 2.0 with Okta
- SAML 2.0 with OneLogin
- SAML 2.0 with Google
- SAML 2.0 with Rippling
- SAML 2.0 with JumpCloud
- OAuth 2.0 (OIDC) with Google
- OAuth 2.0 (OIDC) with Microsoft Azure
- SAML 2.0 with Microsoft Azure
- OAuth 2.0 (OIDC) with Okta

Single sign-on feature (hereafter SSO) provides security at scale by controlling access and managing login credentials while using your company’s IdP via both SAML 2.0 and OAuth 2.0 (OIDC) (Office 365, Okta, Azure, Active Directory, Google, OneLogin…).

This is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace toEnterprise plan.

In order to use SSO, you first need to move your workspace to subdomain. Once you do that, you can configure SSO settings and disable other login methods.

## Setting up custom subdomain#

### Moving to subdomain#

Before you can configure and start using SSO for authorization, you need to move your Clockify app domain to acustom subdomain.

When you upgrade your Clockify subscription toEnterprise plan, you will getAuthenticationtab in theWorkspacesettings. There, you can enter the subdomain you’d like to use and move your workspace there.

To set up subdomain:

- Navigate to theAuthenticationtab in theWorkspace settings
- Enter your custom subdomain in the provided field
- ClickCreate subdomainandCreateto confirm the action

After you created your subdomain and moved your workspace there, Google login will no longer work for you and your users.

If you’d, however, like to use Google login, you need to set it up manually by configuringOAuth 2.0 (OIDC)forSSO.

For more information, check out theOAuth 2.0 (OIDC) with Googlesection below.

### Accessing Clockify from subdomain#

After you create your subdomain, you’ll automatically be logged out of any apps you were logged in with your Clockify account. You’ll have access to them only through the subdomain you created (e.g. https://yourcompanysubdomain.clockify.me/login).

### Workspaces on subdomain#

Subdomain is tied to only one workspace. Users on subdomain can’t have multiple workspaces: there is no workspace switcher, no workspaces in the sidebar, and no access to subdomain workspace from the main domain.

To access multiple workspaces, log in to the main Clockify domain.

### Changing subdomain#

You can change subdomain URL at any time.

Once you change your URL, your Users will be logged out and will have to use the workspace through the new URL.

If you cancel the subscription to the Enterprise plan:

- you’ll move back to the main domain when the subscription expires
- your subdomain will become available for others to use
- your users will have to log in with their email

### API keys on subdomain#

For security reasons, each user on subdomain gets a separate API key that works only for that workspace – meaning, no one can access your data on your subdomain unless they have the right authorization.

If, for example, there is a user with two separate Enterprise workspaces, workspace owners can’t see, or access data from each others accounts.

## Inviting new users#

Once you’re in the subdomain workspace, you can invite users one by oneusing email(like before), or let anyone join without you having to manually invite them.

To let anyone join, check theUsers can join without an invitecheckbox.

If you use SSO and someone without an account tries to log in, the account will be automatically created for them and they’ll log in.

If you allowLog in with email, people will be able to create an account and automatically join your workspace.

## Configuring SSO#

If you’d like to use SSO via your mobile devices (android or iOS) all the SSO configurations supported by Clockify should contain[yourcompany subdomain].clockify.melinks. For example, in theRedirect URLsection addhttps://yourcompanysubdomain.clockify.me/login/android/oauth2orhttps://yourcompanysubdomain.clockify.me/login/ios/oauth2link.

Clockify supports all major SSO identity providers:

- SAML 2.0 (Google,OneLogin,Okta,Azure,Rippling,JumpCloud)
- OAuth 2.0 (OIDC) (Google,Azure,Okta)

Only workspace owner can seeAuthorizationtab, manage subdomain, configure SSO, and turn SSO on/off.

If you wish to force everyone to log in with SSO, simply turn off theLog in with emailoption. Once this change has been saved, your workspace members accounts will be required to use SSO to log in.

Data in the SSO configuration can always be edited or deleted. If deleted, your users will have to switch back to logging in by using email.

Owner can always log in using the original credentials athttps://mysubdomain.clockify.me/login-owner

To addDefault Relay State, use the parameters below.

Make sure to use curly brackets and straight quotes instead of the curly ones, otherwise it won’t work.

Example of Default Relay State:

```
{"location":"https://yourcompanysubdomain.clockify.me", "organizationName":"yourcompanysubdomain"}
```

# [ARTICLE] Data regions for Clockify
https://clockify.me/help/getting-started/data-regions

In this article

- Data regions
- How it works
- Log in to workspace on region
- Change region
- Data residency and API

With data regions, Clockify users can choose the specific region where their workspace data is stored.

Only the workspace Owner can enable or change data residency for a workspace

This feature is available onPROandENTERPRISEplans.

Choosing data regions (residency) mainly changes where your data is stored when it’s not being used. It doesn’t change how Clockify handles your data otherwise, or where other types of data are stored. If you don’t choose a specific data region, your workspace data will be stored in the global region by default.

## Data regions#

Clockify offers data regions in the following locations:

- USA (United States)
- EU (Germany)
- UK (United Kingdom)
- AU (Australia)

## How it works#

### Data stored in your chosen region

Once data residency is enabled, the following categories of user data will be stored in a data center within your selected region:

- Time entries (tasks, projects, clients, tags)
- User activity data (e.g. auto-tracked programs, URLs)
- Invoice details and related financial records
- Workspace configurations specific to your data
- Search indexes of your workspace data

### Data stored outside your chosen region

Some categories of data may be stored in regions outside of your selected data region in yourCAKE.comaccount, for operational purposes such as:

- Clockify member profiles (basic user account information: email, name, profile picture)
- Organization/workspace details (Org name, status, membership information)
- Data used for internal metrics (e.g. seat count, usage)
- Logs and analytics for quality of service
- System-generated IDs (e.g. workspace, kiosk)

## Log in to workspace on region#

When youlog into Clockify, all of your workspaces, including those hosted on region, will appear in your workspace list.To access a workspace onregion, click on its name and you’ll be redirected to it.

## Change region#

You can change data hosting region for your workspace:

- Go to theWorkspace settings
- Choose theAuthenticationtab
- Click onChange regionin theData regionsection
- Choose the region from the dropdown

You’ll see information about what this data region change may affect. ClickContinueandStart data transferto begin the process.If all conditions for the region change are met, the transfer will start.

During the transfer, you and all workspace users will be logged out and cannot access the workspace or track time. Transfers can take up to 12 hours.

### Workspace data transfer#

All active workspace users will be notified when the transfer starts, when it’s completed, or if it fails. If the transfer fails, your workspace will remain on its original server.

During transfer:

- The workspace is locked and unavailable. (If you’re a member of another workspace, you can switch to it)
- Any installed add-ons are automatically uninstalled
- API operations are locked

Backup copy of your transferred workspace remains in the source region for 7 days. This backup is locked and will be deleted after that period.

Transfer won’t occur if any user in your workspace already has an account on the destination region’s server.

### Global vs. regional data transfers#

- Owners can transfer data from a global server to a regional server
- Transfers from a regional server back to global arenot possible
- If you prefer regional hosting but started globally, follow the instructions above to transfer
- By default, when creating your workspace, your data will be hosted on a global server, regardless of your physical location
- While you can’t go from a regional server to a global one, youcanchoose to transfer your data from one regional server to another (e.g. from EU to AU)

## Data residency and API#

If your workspace data is hosted on a regional server, you must use a region-specific URL for your API calls to ensure requests reach your data’s correct destination.

| Global API – base URL | Regional API – base URL |
| https://clockify.me/api/v1/ | EU:https://euc1.clockify.me/api/v1/ |
| USA:https://use2.clockify.me/api/v1/ |
| UK:https://euw2.clockify.me/api/v1/ |
| AU:https://apse2.clockify.me/api/v1/ |

To get data from the workspace in the EU region, usehttps://euc1.clockify.me/api/v1/get/workspacesinstead of the defaulthttps://clockify.me/api/v1/get/workspaces.

Also, if you create a custom subdomain on a regional server, your API URL will follow the format [subdomainname.clockify.me].For example https://subdomainname.clockify.me/api/v1/get/workspaces.

After a regional transfer, new API keys are generated. This way your API requests are correctly routed to your new data region.

The results on the page can be grouped on three levels based on the entities you choose.

## Group entries#

When you’re analyzing the Assignments report, you have the option to group entries in three levels. As a result, the report will organize the data based on the intersection of these criteria and the total hours tracked by users within those groups.

- First level of grouping:Project,User,Group,Client,Month,Week, orDate
- Second level of grouping:Project,Task,Client,Group,Month,Week, orDate
- Third level of grouping:Task,Group,Month,Week, orDate

For example, you might choose to first group your Assignments report byProject, then within each project, group byTask, and finally, within each task, further divide byDate.

Project > Task > Date

In theAssignmentsreport, this grouping look like this:

You can also filter the results by date in the date picker, team (users and groups), client or project and export them inCSV/Excelformat.

If you, for instance, group by User or Group, you’ll getavailableandscheduledhours and, in that way, can determine user’s availability for the selected date range.

## Export Assignments report#

If you’d like to obtain the Assignments report and distribute it in CSV or Excel format to subject matter experts, relevant parties, or internally in your company, you can do that from theAssignmentsreport page.

- At the top right corner of the page, click theExportbutton to expand dropdown
- Choose preferred formatCSV/Excel

The report will be downloaded and saved on your computer.

The grouping options affect the way your exports look. For example, if you group by project, further group by task and finally group by date, that’s the way data will be grouped in the export, as well.

# [ARTICLE] Clockify subscription issues
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/clockify-subscription-management

In this article

- I'm being charged for more seats than I have team members
- I can’t add or remove seats
- My payment failed
- My subscription renewed on an expired card
- I can’t change the country on the customer information page

This article covers the most common subscription-related issues and explains how to resolve them.

## I’m being charged for more seats than I have team members#

Clockify subscriptions are seat-based, which means that every active seat in your workspace is billed, regardless of whether a user is currently deactivated.

If you’ve deactivated users on the Team page but haven’t adjusted your seat count, those seats will still remain on your subscription and continue to be charged. To lower your costs for the next billing cycle, you’ll need to remove the extra seats manually.

Here’s how:

- Go to your Workspace Settings by clicking on the three dots next to your workspace name
- Select Subscription
- Find the current seat count and click Remove next to it
- Confirm the change

If the Remove button is grayed out, that means you still have active users occupying all seats. In that case, first go to the Team page, find the user you’d like to deactivate, click the three dots next to their name, and select Deactivate. Then return to the Subscription page to remove the seat.

## I can’t add or remove seats#

If the option to remove or add seats is grayed out on your Subscription page, there are a couple of possible reasons:

- You’re paying via wire transfer

In this case, you won’t be able to manage seats directly from the app. Instead, you can either:

- Contact us atsupport@clockify.me, and we’ll add the seats for you and issue an updated invoice. The minimum number of seats is five (5).
- Or, if you’d prefer self-service, add credit card details to your account and purchase additional seats with the card.

Clockify subscriptions are billed by credit card. Special conditions apply for wire transfer payments. If you’d like to explore this option for larger purchases, please contact sales@clockify.me.

- Your invoice is overdue

When there’s an unpaid invoice on your account, the option to remove seats is disabled. To fix this:

- Process the latest invoice from your Invoices page.
- Or, reach out to our support team atsupport@clockify.meand we’ll help you resolve it.

Once the issue is cleared, you’ll be able to add or remove seats normally.

If your invoice is overdue and you’d like to reduce the number of seats, our team can void the unpaid invoice and downgrade your workspace to the Free plan. From there, you’ll be able to upgrade again with the preferred number of seats.Please keep in mind that this process may slightly change your settings and billing cycle (for example, you may need to re-enable certain paid features).

## My payment failed#

If you have a valid subscription but your payment fails (for example, due to incorrect payment information, insufficient funds, or an expired credit card), you’ll enter a two-week grace period. During this time:

- Go to the Subscription page
- Update your payment information
- Retry the payment manually, or wait for our payment processor to automatically retry the transaction

If the payment isn’t processed by the end of the grace period, your workspace will be downgraded to the free plan. You won’t lose any data, but you will lose access to paid features.

If you are unsure why your payment failed, here are a few things to check:

- 3D Secure: Make sure 3D Secure is enabled on your card. Without it, online transactions may be declined.
- Online payments: Confirm your card is authorized for online payments. Some cards have restrictions or require prior approval for internet transactions.
- Issuing bank: Contact your bank to verify there aren’t any blocks or restrictions on your card.

Once everything is confirmed and corrected, retry updating your payment method on the Subscription page.

## My subscription renewed on an expired card#

If your subscription was renewed using a card that has technically expired, this happens because of how payment processing works between Stripe (our payment processor) and your issuing bank.

- Clockify uses Stripe as a payment processor. If a card was saved in Stripe before its expiration date, Stripe may still attempt charges after it expires. Whether the charge goes through depends entirely on the issuing bank.
- In many cases,banks allow these charges to succeed to avoid disrupting recurring payments, giving customers time to update their payment method.
- If you’d like to prevent this from happening again, we recommend updating your payment information on the Subscription page with your new card details.

## I can’t change the country on the customer information page#

If you’d like to update the country in your billing details, keep in mind:

- Customers can’t change the country field themselves
- If no country is set, or if you need to switch to a different one, please reach out to our support team atsupport@clockify.me
- Our billing team will update the country information for you

Changing the country may also change the currency of your subscription, which requires adjustments to your billing setup from our team.

### Things to remember:#

- If an add-on is already installed in a workspace, that workspace will be disabled in the dropdown
- For workspaces in specific regions, the add-on may not save data there due to the data protection regulations.This means that Clockify doesn’t have an insight into where add-on data is stored. Add-ons might store data in regions different from the Workspace region.

## Troubleshooting#

In the unlikely event of an error occurring during an installation process, anAdd-on maintenancescreen will appear notifying you that the installation is temporarily unavailable.

- Add-on name
- Date of update
- Date of installation: In case of reinstallation, the last date is shown
- Who installed
- Add-on status
- Date of deactivation (if there is any)

Add-ons listed here are sorted in the descending order based on their installation details. Unlisted add-ons are also visible in the list.

Please note that you can access unlisted add-ons directly from your Clockify profile, or through the direct link.However, the access is limited to workspaces where the add-on was initially installed.

#### Add-on status#

If your account needs to be verified, you’ll be redirected to theClockify login pagewhere you’ll be prompted to verify your account.

## Delete Marketplace account#

If you clickDelete account, a new page with account deletion details appears requiring you to confirm the action.

Account deletion occurs automatically when all associated products are deleted, since there is no way to sign in without them.

If you delete a Clockify account, that account will be deleted from all connected workspaces.

After account is deleted:

- Installed add-ons are uninstalled
- Subscription is canceled for paid add-ons

## Remove Marketplace account#

### Line items#

Editing line items from the imported items (e.g. changing description, amount, or cost) won’t affect the actual time entries. If you delete a line item, all time entries from that item will lose their invoiced status.

Each imported expense will be marked asinvoicedso you don’t accidentally invoice the same expense twice. If you remove a line item that contains imported expenses (or delete the whole invoice), those expenses will be marked asuninvoiced.

# [ARTICLE] Export user info
https://clockify.me/help/administration/export-user-info

If you’re managing a lot of users and would like to have a single file that summarizes all their data (name, email address, billable rate, role…), you can do that by using theExportuser info feature onTeamspage.

By exporting info to a CSV/Excel file, you can easily analyze it and even integrate it with some other tools like accounting software, project management tools or some CRM (customer relationship management) systems.

User info export is available on all subscription plans, but can only be performed by Admins.

The type of info that is exported depends on the selected filters. If not filtered out otherwise, all active and inactive users are downloaded by default. Also, since invited users do not have a name set until they join the workspace, theNamecolumn is empty.

*Full/Limited tabs are visible only if Kiosk is enabled in the Workspace settings. Also, you’ll have the PIN column with users’ PIN codes when downloading the file.If the Kiosk feature is not enabled, then theTeampage will look like this:

# [ARTICLE] Split entry
https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/split-time-entries

In this article

- Time tracker
- Calendar
- Pending approvals

Split long entries into shorter segments and improve granularity in your time tracking.UseTime trackerorCalendarto split entries based on either their duration, or specific times of the day and add more flexibility and precision when managing your time.

Split entry option is available to users on paid plans and onFree trial.

All users can perform this action, but admins can split time for all other team members in Calendar. However, ifWho can edit time and expenses for othersis set toAdmins and Team managers, then Team managers are also able to split time for their team members in Calendar.

You can split both time and break entries. The step-by-step procedure is the same.

## Time tracker#

Time tracker contains a list of time/break entries that have been tracked, or those currently running in a workspace.

Time can be split for the running and existing entries. The steps are the same with the only difference being the type of entry you’re choosing in the Time tracker (the one that is running, or the one from the list).

To split entry:

- Go toTime trackerpage
- Navigate to the entry you’d like to split
- Click on thethree dots
- ChooseSplitoption
- In theSplit atbox write the time at which you’d like the split to occuror
- Toggle the bar on the timeline to the number you’d like to split
- ClickSaveto complete the action

If you split a running entry, as a result, you’ll get two entries with the first one having start and end time and the second one running with the start time being the end time of the first one.For example:Entry has been running since 9:00 and now it’s 12:30. You split it at 10:00 and now you have two entries, with the first one being9:00 – 10:00 and the second one 10:00 and running.

Entries can be split a minute after the start time and a minute before the ending time, meaning that entries shorter than two minutes cannot be split.

If there are multiple identical hours and minutes for which the entry spans, you can split time via the input field only for the first one.

If an entry has screenshots, they are split between two entries based on the time of creation.For example:The entry lasts 10:00 – 10:30. It is split to: 10:00 – 10:15 and 10:15 – 10: 30. The screenshots created in the 10:00 – 10:15 time span belong to that time entry. Same goes for the other split entry.

The same logic applies to GPS location tracking. They are also split between two entries based on the time of creation.

### Modify duration#

Duration of split entries can be modified:

- Navigate to the blue circle
- Move the arrow to the left or right

Entries are dynamic and change in real time to match new end time and duration. As one half of the timeline changes, the other one changes dynamically according to that.

## Calendar#

You can also split running and already created entries in the Calendar. Steps are the same.

- Go to theCalendarpage
- Click on the running/existing entry
- Edit windows appears
- Click on thethree dotsmenu at the bottom left corner
- ChooseSplitoption
- In theSplit atbox write the time at which you’d like the split to occuror
- Toggle the bar on the timeline to the number you’d like to split
- ClickSaveto complete the action

If Force timer is on, the split time option is not available at all.

## Pending approvals#

Admins and Team managers (for their teams) can perform this action only ifWho can edit time and expenses for othersis set toAdmins and team managers.

You can also split time forpending time entrieson theApprovalspage:

- Go to theApprovalspage
- ChoosePendingtab
- Click on pending timesheet that contains entry you want to split
- Choose the entry and click on edit icon
- Edit time entrywindow appears
- Click on the three dots at the bottom left corner
- ChooseSplitfrom the dropdown
- In theSplit atbox write the time at which you’d like the split to occuror
- Toggle the bar on the timeline to the number you’d like to split
- ClickSaveto complete the action


# [ARTICLE] Manage member’s time
https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/manage-members-time

In this article

- Forgot to submit time
- Mend timesheets

As a Team manager or Admin, you can oversee and manage the time entries and expenses submitted by the members of your workspace or team.

For example, imagine you’re a department manager responsible for overseeing a team of marketing specialists. Each user submits their tracked time entries and expenses for various marketing campaigns and projects. As the manager, you review these submissions to verify the accuracy of tracked hours and expenses, to make sure that they align with project budgets and client agreements.

Managing tracked time is available on Standard and higher subscription plans and can be performed by workspace Admins and Team managers.Managing tracked expenses is available on PRO and higher subscription plans and can be performed by workspace Admins and Team managers.

## Forgot to submit time#

Admins and Team managers (for members of their team) can check whether users added their time entries during the week and send reminders to users that didn’t track time or submit their timesheets.

This functionality is part of theApprovalsfeature and is available to users that have theApprovalsenabled.

Users that didn’t log their time during the week are displayed in theUnsubmittedtab.Inactive and Limited users are not displayed in this list.

To see who has unsubmitted time:

- Go toApprovals
- ChooseUnsubmittedtab
- Users with unapproved time will appear
- Click on time and you’ll jump to their timesheet
- Navigate between time range and filter by user or group
- ClickRemindto submitand send an email reminder to all the users you see in the table
- Alternatively, submit timesheet for the user by clicking on three dots and thenSubmit

To see who doesn’t have ANY approved time (users who forgot to fill and submit timesheets):

- Go to theWeeklyreport
- Group report by user
- Select the week you wish to review
- Choose filterStatus
- ChooseApprovedand apply filter
- ClickShow users without time

Users with 0 time indicate they don’t have any approved time.

or

- Go toApprovalspage
- ChooseUnsubmittedtab
- Click onShow users without time
- ClickRemind to log and submit(button is clickable if there is at least one user with untracked time)
- New screen pops up with a list of all the users that will receive the reminder
- ClickSendto complete the action

As a result:

- Users that didn’t submit timesheet get an email reminder to submit timesheet
- Users that have untracked time, get a reminder to log their time and submit their timesheet

## Mend timesheets#

Approved time is locked permanently. It can’t be edited even if you turn off Approvals or downgrade your account.

Regular users can add new time to their approved time period, as long as the dates are not locked. If they add more time, they’ll have to submit that time for approval again. In that case, the manager will be able to approve or reject only the newly added time (previously approved time remains).

If there was a mistake and, as an Admin, you need to make changes to approved time:

- Go toApproval
- ChooseArchivetab
- Find the time period that needs fixing
- Click on the approval request to open its details
- ClickWithdrawapproval in the upper right corner
- Leave a note, detailing what was wrong, why, and what needs changing
- ClickWithdraw

Once approval is withdrawn, all time entries approved by that request will become editable by admins inDetailed report(plus by their owners, if the dates are not locked). Both the user and all the admins will receive the email containing the note.

When time becomes unapproved, a permanent copy of all the previously approved time entries (along with their original hourly rates) will be created in theWithdrawntab for audit purposes, so you always have a written trace of all the changes.

# [ARTICLE] Assign currency to client
https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/assign-currency-to-client

In this article

- Assign currency
- Client currency in Clockify

In case you’re working on projects for clients that use various currencies, instead of using one currency on a workspace level for all your projects, you can assign different currencies to different clients.For example:Client A is using US dollars as a currency and Client B euros. You can record project-related expenses in US dollars for Client A and in euros for Client B.

The currency assigned on a workspace level is assigned by default to all the clients available in the workspace. To assign currency to a client, you need to be an admin and your workspace needs to be on aPROor higher subscription plan.

## Assign currency#

To assign currency to client:

- Go to theClientspage in your workspace
- In the list ofClients,locatetheclient you wish to edit
- Click on theEditbutton next to their name
- Choose the currency from the search bar that appears with all available currencies in the workspace

Currency assigned to a client will be referred to asclient currencyhereafter.

## Client currency in Clockify#

#### Trial#

- After downgrade or the end of a trial period, all currencies are changed back to the default currency
- Subscription restores currency settings that were in place before the trial period

Currency is present in all client-related actions, from the client creation or editing, to the amount overview in the dashboard, project status and so on. If other than default currency is assigned to a client, it affectsadding time entriesthroughout the app andClients,Expenses,Reports,ProjectsandInvoicespages.

#### Clients#

By default, every default client gets a default workspace currency.

Whenever the currency related to the client changes, updated currency values will be presented with the new one being marked as updated.

#### Adding time entries in Time tracker, Timesheet, Calendar, Detailed report#

Entry’s billable and cost amounts are calculated indefault currencyif:

- entry doesn’t have a project
- entry’s project doesn’t have a client

Entry’s billable and cost amounts are calculated inclient currencyif:

- entry’s project has a client with assigned specific currency

For imported entries, currency is derived from the project.

Currency is related to the client, not entry, so if the currency is changed on a client level, all entries assigned to those client’s projects will get a new currency. Also, if a project or a client related to that project is deleted, all time entries related to that project get the default currency.

#### Expenses#

In case currency is assigned to client,thedefault currencyis still used when:

- adding a new expense category that has a unit price
- expense’s project is deleted from the workspace
- project’s client is deleted from the workspace

If client currency, or default currency changes, those changes will not impact the already existing records, only the future ones.

#### Report#

You can filter out reports by currencies, or find a currency in the search bar at the top of the page.

Different client currencies are displayed in summary report, time and expense reports and exported formats.

#### Project#

The currency displayed in projects is the one related to the client. If there is no client on the project, the default currency is displayed.

#### Invoices#

Since all invoices are made for a specific client, the amount is displayed in client currency. If the client’s invoice is updated, the existing invoice is updated to that currency, as well.

For more information on how to create multiple currencies in a workspace, check outSet up multiple currencies.

- Manage holidays
- Manage policies
- Define policy
- Edit or delete policy

Define and manage holidays and policies on theTime offpage.

Time off is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace to Standard, Pro, or Enterprise plan.

To manage your non-working days:

- Navigate to theTime offpage
- Click on theSettingsicon
- Define working days in theWorkspace settings(Saturdays and Sundays are marked as non-working days, by default).

## Manage holidays#

Manage holidays by creating multiple ones, assigning different people to different holidays (e.g. if some people don’t get time off for a specific holiday), specifying if you’d like the holiday to occur annually and defining a holiday color. Choose one, or make a custom holiday color.

When people request time off, holidays and weekends won’t count.

For example, if someone requests Jan 1 – Jan 7 for time off – and Jan 1 is holiday, Jan 2 is Saturday, and Jan 3 is Sunday – their total request will be 4 days for time off.

Created holidays are displayed in descending chronological order.Annual holidays without a specific year are sorted by date, either for this year or the next, depending on today’s date.

To edit or delete holidays:

- Go to theTime offpage
- Click on theSettingsbutton at the top right corner of the page
- ChooseManageholidays
- Click onthree dots>Editnext to the holiday in theHolidaysscreen

You can edit the holiday name, people assigned to it, period of time, its annual occurrence and color.

Deleting or changing working days doesn’t impact existing time off requests.

## Manage policies#

Holiday policies can be managed in the same way as holidays.

You can:

- Create multiple policies
- Assign different people to different policies (e.g. if certain policy doesn’t apply to certain people)
- Check if the policy requires approval and needs to be approved by admin or manager, or some other specific member

## Define policy#

- Enter a policy name
- Choose members or groups of members to which the policy will be applied
- Define time unit (days or hours) – optional
- Define if policy requires approval of admins, managers or specific members (optional)
- Choose if policy can be accrued after a certain period of time
- Select if negative balance or half day off is allowed
- Specify a policy color: Choose one, or make a custom policy color.

## Edit or delete policy#

To edit or delete policies:

- Navigate to the Settings button in the Time off page
- ChooseManage policiesfrom the dropdown
- In thePoliciesscreen, click on three dots next to the policy
- Choose the policy you’d like to edit
- Open the three-dots menu for the policy
- Choose toEdit/Archivethe policy

When managing holiday and time off policies, please note that you can enable automatic creation of time off and holiday entries. Approved time off requests and holidays can be tracked for the project you choose with the billability pulled from that project or task.

Holiday and policy colors previously defined are visible on Timesheet, Calendar, Time off and Schedule pages.

Only archived policies can be deleted.

In this article

- Create request
- Email notifications

Simplify coordination between you and your team members when it comes to your team’s time-off needs. Improve productivity with automated processes.

Time off is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace to Standard, Pro or Enterprise plan.

## Create request#

To request a time off:

- Go toTime offpage
- ClickRequest time off
- Choose time off policy (you can see all policies and how many days/hours you have available in the dropdown)
- Specify period (holidays and weekends won’t be counted toward total)
- Add an optional note for the approver
- ClickSubmit

If you don’t have enough balance (and the policy doesn’t allow for negative balance), you won’t be able to select that policy.

If you have multiple balances active for a period, the app will automatically deduct days from the balance that is expiring the soonest.

If you made a mistake, you can withdraw your pending request by clicking on the three dots next to your request (when the pending request is withdrawn, your manager and admin will receive an email).

Approved time off requests cannot be withdrawn.

If you’re an admin or team manager, you can request time off on behalf of other users by choosing their name from a dropdown menu.

When doing this, the types of time off you can select from (available in the Time off policy dropdown) will be based on what policies the user is eligible for and how much time off they have left.

Also, there is a mandatory default note—’Request made by manager’—which you can edit before submitting the request.

## Email notifications#

Manage time off email notifications by adjusting your preferences in theEmail notificationstab of your Profile settings

- When someone requests time off, the person responsible for approving that request will get an email (as defined in the policy)
- Admins receive email notification only if they’re the only ones that can approve time off requests.
- If team managers can approve requests, admin can receive email notifications by assigning themselves a team manager role users they manage.
- When time off is approved (or rejected), the person who has requested the time off and their team manager will receive an email.


# [ARTICLE] Approve time off
https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/approve-time-off

In this article

- Requests tab
- View team members' leaves

When a member requests time off, the person responsible for that policy will get an email (either their team manager, or a specific person for the whole policy).

Time off is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace to Standard, Pro, or Enterprise plan.Time off requests can be approved by the Owner/Admin, or by a Team Manager for their team members.

## Requests tab#

Time off requests can be approved on theTime offunder theRequeststab where you’ll find a list of all requests awaiting your approval.

Filterall requests bystatus(pending, approved, rejected), and by a specific team member (according to date).

Rejecta request and write a note, and the person who made the request will receive an email notification.You can also reject previously approved requests in case there was an error.

You can click on the note icon to see submission and reject notes, and hover over the status label to see who approved the request and when.

If a person doesn’t have enough days/hours, and the policy doesn’t allow negative balance, the request’s total will be red and the request can’t be approved.

## View team members’ leaves#

You can see all team members who have scheduled leaves in the Timeline tab, so you can plan and synchronize leaves better.

You can see leaves for the next 30 days, or choose a custom time range.

Only people who have time off in that period will show up on the timeline as blocks:

- Green (default) – approved time off request
- Orange (default) – pending request that’s waiting approval
- Gray (default) – holiday

Although these are the default colors for policy and holiday, you can change them when creating a new policy or holiday, or wheneditingthe existing ones. This way, instead of the default green, you can have a color defined in policy as a color of approved time off request, lighter shade of policy color for pending request and color defined in holiday as the color indicating holiday.

Who can see what:

- Admins can see time off for everyone
- Team managers can see time off for their team members
- Regular users can see their own, plus time off for their team (e.g. their team manager’s users). If you enable Regular users can see time off outside their teams in workspace settings, they’ll be able to see everyone’s time off.

- Manage accruals
- Balance history

Time off is a paid feature, which you can enable byupgradingyour workspace to Standard, Pro, or Enterprise plan.

Use theBalancetab to track the days you’ve accrued for time off. See how much time off each member has for each policy, how much they’ve used up and the detailed log of changes in their balance history.

## Manage accruals#

You can view balance by policy (e.g. vacation balance for each team member) or by user (e.g. balance for each policy for a specific user).

Regular users can see balance history only for their own policies, admins can see everyone’s, and team managers can see their team members’:

- Accrued – how many days or hours a person received
- Used – how many days or hours a person used up by requesting time off
- Available – how many days or hours a person has left which they can use when requesting time off (accrued minus used)

Before people can take time off, you first need to give them days (or hours), which they can use up when requesting time off:

- If a person doesn’t have any time accrued, you can set initial balance by clickingAddnext to their name
- You can add or remove accrual days/hours by clicking on the three dots (and leave a comment why the person received or lost time off)
- When adding days/hours you can define avalidity period(a start and end date) to any time off balance. This means the balance expires and is automatically removed after the set date.
- You can add or remove days/hours in bulk when you view balance grouped by policy, and then check for which users you wish to add/remove time off

When admin adds or removes time off manually, the accrued columns are updated.

When a person’s balance is manually updated (via add or remove), they and their team manager will receive an email.

## Balance history#

If you need to know why a certain person has X number of days, you can click on the three dots and click History.

- Regular users can see only their own balance, as well as balance history.
- Admins can see balance for each person, as well as add or remove accrued days/hours.
- Team managers can see balance and balance history for all their members, but can’t edit it.

Balance history lists all the time off requests a person made, their status, and changes to their accrual: you can see what was changed, when, and who made it:

- Pending and approved requests remove time from the balance
- Rejected and withdrawn requests add back the original time to the balance
- Admin’s manual action can add or remove from accrued balance (e.g. a member receives days off when a new period starts, or they work overtime and receive time in lieu)

- entries and assignments are always placed based on their start time:e.g. Weekly reset is set for today, 2pm. Assignment is scheduled from 12pm-6pm. The assignment is assigned to the first half of the day, which belongs to the previous week. This week’s time range is from 2pm today to midnight and there is no assignment in that period.
- midnight is automatically assigned if assignment doesn’t have start time(belongs to the first part of the day)
- today’s dot on the chart always belongs to the Forecasted line:e.g. Estimate reset is set to 2pm, so the first part of the day belongs to the previous week, however, it will still have a forecasted value for that dot until today is over

If week/month is selected from the period picker andTodayis included in the selected period, everything up toTodayis completed and everything afterToday,to the end of the week/month isScheduled. Therefore,Today’stracked hours will be included in the total ofCompletedtasks after midnight, in your timezone.

## Project budget chart#

Forecasting budget chart shows project expenses based on the estimated budget allocated to that project. Budget forecasting supports budget estimates using scheduled assignments, time entries, and expenses. The chart reflects either the set budget or the highest value reached if the budget is exceeded.

If no data is available for the project (e.g. time entries, expenses, estimates), the forecasting chart will be empty.

### Legend#

Chart legend is located at the top-right corner of the page.

The chart displays three lines:

Completed(solid blue line)

Represents the total budget spent up to the present day. The completed line is not displayed for future periods.

Forecasted(dotted blue line)

Represents the prediction of the project’s progress based on realized and scheduled data. It starts with Today and changes its look once it becomes a budget.

Budget(solid dark gray line)

Static, horizontal line that represents the budget set per project.

Each line represents a continuous trend from the first to the last data point. Lines show both ascending and descending trends with cumulative values.If a budget reset is configured, the line will be color-coded to indicate whether the estimate has been exceeded (e.g. the line turns red if the budget is exceeded).

### Budget reset#

If a budget reset is enabled, the estimates will adjust accordingly: weekly, monthly, or yearly, each indicating the project will be under/over/on budget by Y [currency] for the respective time period.

### Possible scenarios#

1.Project budget hasn’t reached estimated valueForecast curve hasn’t reached the budget line, meaning the last point shows a remaining value greater than zero. Currently, the project is expected to come in under budget by Y [currency].

2.Project budget reached estimated valueForecasted curve has reached the budget line and the last point shows a value equal to zero. The project is within the estimated budget range expressed in Y [currency].

3.Project budget is over estimated valueThe forecast curve has exceeded the budget line, showing a remaining value less than zero. This means the project is expected to go over budget by Y USD, where Y is the absolute value of the last forecast point.

- Budget estimation details

In addition to tracking time spent on projects and tasks, Clockify allows you to forecast the budget allocated to each project or task. This feature helps you plan your budget in advance and prepare for future projects.

This feature is available to all admin users with a Pro and higher subscription plans and during Free trial.

To enable project budget estimation, project billability needs to be activated in theWorkspace settings.

To enable billability:

- OpenWorkspace settings
- Go toBillable hourssection inPermissionstab
- Turn onActivate billable hours

This way, all the entries created on that workspace will be marked as billable, allowing you to set a budget and effectively monitor expenses.

You can customize billability settings for specific projects as needed.

To enableproject billability:

- Open theProjectspage in the sidebar
- Choose the project you wish to configure
- Navigate to theSettingstab
- In theBillableby defaultsection, toggle the switch to enable billability

With this setting, all tasks created for that project will automatically be billable.

Now, you can proceed and set up a project budget.

To set up project budget:

- Navigate to theProjectspage
- Select the desired project from the list
- Click on theSettingstab
- In theProject estimatesection, selectProject budgetfrom the dropdown menu

If you are manually tracking the budget, don’t forget to set the applicable rate.

## Budget estimation details#

- The budget forecasting chart is made out of the values on the X and Y axes, with the intersection representing the data points
- All numerical values follow yourWorkspace settingsfor formatting
- Values are displayed with two decimal places, and the currency is determined by your Workspace settings or a specific client

Y axis:

- Represents monetary values (amount of money)
- The minimal value is where the two axes first intersect, while the maximal value is the highest point on the chart within the selected date range
- Only numbers are shown, excluding currency symbols

X axis:

- Displays dates, with the time range adjustable at the top right corner of the page
- Horizontal line above the Y axis represents the project’s budget. This status line adjusts if the project’s budget changes, including weekly, monthly, or annual resets.

When the project’s budget is exceeded, the forecasted line will continue beyond the estimated budget line, reflecting continued expenses.

For example:If the budget for the initial months of the year was $5,000 and $150 was spent, the budget line will be positioned on the chart according to its value relative to the Y axis.

# [ARTICLE] Can I restrict API key access?
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/can-i-restrict-api-key-access

Currently,Clockifydoes not offer the ability to restrict API keys toread-onlyaccess for specific workspaces. The permissions available through the API are tied to the user’s role in the workspace.

Whatever actions a user can perform in the Clockify UI, they can also perform using their API key. This means there’s no way to create a key with limited permissions or restricted access to certain workspace data.

# [ARTICLE] Deactivated user is displayed as active in API
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/deactivated-user-is-showing-as-active-in-api

In this article

- Explanation
- Solution

If you encounter an issue where a deactivated user is showing asACTIVEvia the API, it’s important to understand how Clockify handles user status.

## Explanation#

When a user is deactivated from a specific workspace, their account is not deleted from the Clockify database.If the user is a member of multiple workspaces, their account will remain active in other workspaces.

## Solution#

- Ensure you are using the correct endpoint:Workspace users:GET /v1/workspaces/{{ws id}}/users
- Workspace users:GET /v1/workspaces/{{ws id}}/users
- To check membership status in a specific workspace, use the query parameter?memberships=ALL:Example:GET /v1/workspaces/{{ws id}}/users/?memberships=ALL
- Example:GET /v1/workspaces/{{ws id}}/users/?memberships=ALL

If the status still showsACTIVE, it is expected behavior. The user is still consideredactivein the system due to their presence in other workspaces.

# [ARTICLE] Why am I getting only 50 projects when I expect more?
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/why-am-i-getting-only-50-projects-when-i-expect-more

In this article

- Solution

Users may report that despite setting a large page-size limit, they only get 50 results. This issue is usually caused by incorrect formatting in the request.

## Solution#

- When setting parameters for page-size, ensure there areno spacesbefore or after the = sign.Incorrect:page-size = 5000Correct:page-size=5000
- Incorrect:page-size = 5000
- Correct:page-size=5000
- Incorrect formatting causes the API to default to the 50-page limit.

Once the correct page size is set, you should receive the full set of results.


# [ARTICLE] How to retrieve more than 50 results via API
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/how-to-retrieve-more-than-50-results-via-api

# [ARTICLE] Categorize time using required fields & tags
https://clockify.me/help/getting-started/categorize-time-using-required-fields-tags

In this article

- Required fields
- Tags
- FAQ

## Required fields#

Required fieldsare the minimum fields that must be completed before a time entry can be created.Use required fields to prevent incomplete time entries, so that all entries have essential data like project, task, tag, and description and improve the accuracy and consistency of your reports.

Required fields can be created on workspaces that are on all paid plans.

To use required fiends as a Team manager or Project manager, you’ll need your Admin to enable this feature in the Workspace settings.

### How required fields work#

Once required fields are enabled, certain fields must be filled out before time entries can be saved or tracked.

For example:

Ifprojectandtagare marked as required, users cannot submit a time entry without selecting a project and tag. Also, the timer cannot be stopped until a project and tag are assigned. Even if the task field is optional, the project and tag fields will be mandatory.If a task is required, only projects with tasks will appear in the project picker. If no tasks exist for a project, that project will not be selectable for time tracking.

Important to note:

- Onlyadminscan set up and change required fields in theWorkspace settings
- If a required field is missing, the system will prompt the user to complete the missing information before the time entry is finalized

## Tags#

Tagsare a powerful tool for categorizing time entries. By associating tags with time entries, you can easily filter and report on various types of work.Use tags to group time entries by specific tasks, clients, project types, or any other criteria relevant to your workflow. Tags make it easier to generate detailed reports and analyze where time is being spent across projects or teams.

### How tags work#

Tags aremandatorywhen required fields are enabled, ensuring all time entries are categorized appropriately. You can use existing tags, or create new ones when entering time.

### Create tags#

- Go to Tags page from sidebar
- Type tag name and click ADD

Or:

- Click tag icon on a time entry
- Start typing tag name
- Click Create tag or press Ctrl/^(Control)+Enter

All deleted tags will be removed from time entries they are assigned to.

#### Manage tags#

- You can set upcustom tagsbased on your project needs
- Tags can beassigned to projects, tasks, and time entries, providing flexibility in how you track and report time.

### Tips for effectively using required fields & tags#

- Makesure all team members use consistent tags for easy reporting and analysis
- Create a tag system (e.g. Client A > Research > Development) to keep entries organized
- Regularly review which fields should be marked as required to adjust it to your team’s evolving needs

## FAQ#

#### Can I set required fields for individual projects or tasks?#

No, required fields are set at theworkspace leveland apply toall time entriesacross the workspace. This means you cannot designate different required fields for individual projects or tasks. For instance, if you mark theProjectandTagfields as required, then every user across all projects in the workspace will need to provide a project and a tag when logging time, regardless of the specific project or task. However, you can customize the required fields for your workspace as a whole by choosing which field (e.g.Project,Task,Tag, orDescription)are mandatory for time entries.

#### Can I disable required fields after enabling them?#

Yes, you can modify the required fields at any time, but onlyadminshave the permissions to do so. If you decide that certain fields no longer need to be mandatory (e.g. you no longer want theDescriptionfield to be required), you can go into theWorkspace settingsand disable that field. However, keep in mind that any changes made to the required fields will apply toall future time entries, and any time entries that were already submitted (even with missing information) will remain as they are.

#### Can I use tags for more detailed reporting?#

Absolutely! Tags are a powerful tool forcategorizingandfilteringyour time entries. By using tags consistently across your workspace, you can easily generate reports based on the tags you’ve assigned. For example, if you use tags for different project phases (e.g. Planning, Development, and Testing), you can filter your time entries to see how much time was spent in each phase. Similarly, tags can be used to differentiate between clients, types of work (e.g. Billable, Internal), or other relevant categories.

#### Can required fields be applied to time entries logged via the mobile app or browser extension?#

Yes, therequired fieldssettings apply to time entries made across all platforms, including themobile appandbrowser extension. If you attempt to log time via any device and the required fields (likeProjectorTag) are not completed, you will be prompted to fill in the missing information before you can save the entry.

#### How do required fields impact existing time entries?#

Required fields only affect new or updated time entries after they are enabled. If the required fields are set up in the middle of a project, time entries that have already been logged will not retroactively require the fields. However, from the moment the required fields are activated, anynew time entriesorupdates to existing entrieswill need to meet the new requirements. This ensures that moving forward, all data logged is complete and organized.

#### Can I customize which users are affected by required fields?#

No, required fields apply to all users in the workspace once enabled, regardless of their role (e.g. Admin, Project Manager, Team Member).For additional assistance or to configure required fields and tags according to your workspace’s specific needs, you can always reach out to yourWorkspace adminor consult ourHelp Centerfor detailed instructions and best practices.

- Client
- User
- Group
- Tag
- Month
- Week
- Date

- By date: Another useful way to view hours is by grouping byDate, which will show you the total hours each employee tracked per day. This is ideal if you need to see abi-weeklyormonthlyreport for your team, and theWeekly reportdoesn’t suit your needs.
- Three levels of grouping: The Summary report supports up to three levels of grouping, providing a more granular view of your data. You can customize the date range to meet your specific reporting needs.

### Weekly report#

TheWeekly reportis designed for weekly tracking of hours worked. You can group the data byUserorProject.

- Perfect for weekly overviews: If you’re monitoring your team’s work on a week-to-week basis, this is a great report for that.

### Detailed report#

TheDetailed reportprovides a comprehensive breakdown of time entries, showing each entry individually without any grouping or summarization.

Steps to filter:

- Go to theReportpage (Summary, Detailed, or Weekly)
- Apply filters: Use the filter options to select the specific employee or group of employees
- View data: The report will now only show the time entries for the selected employee(s)

## Customize reports#

If the built-in Clockify reports don’t meet your exact needs, you can customize your reports byexporting the Detailed Report as CSVand using tools likeExcelorGoogle Sheetsto create your own custom reports.

In Excel or Google Sheets, you can createpivot tablesto rearrange the data into the structure you need.

This flexibility allows you to adjust reports to fit different team structures or project needs.

If you’re on apaid subscription plan, you can also access employeeTimesheetsdirectly, which is similar to the Weekly report but with more customization options.

- Filter timesheets by a specific employee and group byProjectfor detailed tracking of time
- Export timesheets toPDForExcelfor record-keeping or reporting

To export use your browser’sPrint option(Ctrl/Cmd + P) toSave as PDFif you need to save a copy of the Timesheet.

- Exceeds their target (Managers are notified if tracked time is above the set target)

## Troubleshooting: Tracked time not visible in reports#

If a team member claims they’ve tracked time, but you can’t find it in the reports, it could be because they tracked time in adifferent workspace.

What to do:

- Make sure the team member is tracking time in the correct workspace (especially if they’ve created a personal workspace during sign-up).
- If they mistakenly tracked time in their personal workspace, you will need to check that workspace as well.

# [ARTICLE] Define required fields for time entries

In this article

- What are the required fields?
- Enable required fields
- How it works
- What are custom fields?
- Create custom fields
- Make custom fields required
- Best practices for using required fields
- FAQ

By definingrequired fieldsfor time entries, you’re making sure that every entry contains the minimum amount of information needed to be created and saved. This helps you achieve accuracy and consistency across all time entries in your workspace.

Required fields are available on paid plans, so you will need to upgrade your workspace to a Pro or Enterprise plan to access this functionality.

Only Admins and Owners can enable required fields on a workspace.

## What are the required fields?#

Required fields are mandatory fields that must be completed before a time entry can be created or saved. By defining which fields should be required, you make sure that time entries contain the necessary information for proper organization, reporting, and analysis.

## Enable required fields#

Available required fields are predefined and are listed in theWorkspace settings>Generaltab >Do not allow saving time withoutsection.You can choose from the following fields to make mandatory for all time entries:

- Project
- Task
- Tag
- Description

IfTimesheetpage is activated in your workspace settings,Projectfield becomesrequired. You must define a project for an entry to be saved.

## How it works#

If you markProjectandTagas required fields:

- Users willnot be able to add a time entrywithout selecting a project and a tag
- The timer can be started, but itcannot be stoppeduntil both fields are filled in
- Time entries willnot savewithout these two fields

For example, ifTaskis a required field, time entries linked to projects without tasks will not show up in the project picker, preventing incomplete time entries from being submitted.

## What are custom fields?#

In addition to the standard required fields, you can addcustom fieldsto track anything specific to your business needs.

These could include:

- Expenses, mileage, breaks, overtime
- Invoice status, location, equipment
- Links to tickets, receipts, and more

OnlyWorkspace adminsandownershave the permissions to configure custom fields.

## Create custom fields#

To create custom fields for time entries:

- Go toWorkspace settings>Custom fields
- Click onCreate new fieldand select the field type:Text: Free-text inputNumber: Only numerical values (e.g. mileage, expenses)Link: URLs (e.g. links to receipts)Switch: Yes/No options (e.g. paid/unpaid)Select: Dropdown list (e.g. status, location)Select multiple: Allows multiple selections (e.g. equipment used)
- Text: Free-text input
- Number: Only numerical values (e.g. mileage, expenses)
- Link: URLs (e.g. links to receipts)
- Switch: Yes/No options (e.g. paid/unpaid)
- Select: Dropdown list (e.g. status, location)
- Select multiple: Allows multiple selections (e.g. equipment used)

## Make custom fields required#

To set acustom fieldas required for every time entry:

- Make sure the field isVisiblewith a default value, or editable by users
- InWorkspace settings, under theGeneraltab, select the checkbox for the custom field in theDo not allow saving time withoutsection
- The field will now appear as a required field in bothTime trackerandTimesheet, ensuring all users fill it out when entering time

## Best practices for using required fields#

- Make sure your required fields are the same across all projects and workspacese.g.Let’s say that as a marketing manager you need to track[Campaign name]for every time entry. If you make this a required field for your[Social media]project but not for your[Email marketing]project, your company reports will have missing data. By making[Campaign name]a required field for all projects, your data stays clean and complete, making it easy to run reports later.
- Use custom fields to track key business information you need for reports and analysise.g.Yoursoftware development team needs to prioritize bugs. You create a custom field calledBug prioritywith options likehigh,medium, andlow. By requiring your team to fill this out for every bug-related time entry, you can quickly filter your reports to see exactly how much time was spent on high-priority issues.

## FAQ#

#### What happens if I don’t set any fields as required?#

If you don’t set any fields as required, users can submit time entries without completing critical information like the project, task, or description. While this won’t prevent users from adding time entries, it can lead to incomplete or inconsistent data, making reporting and analysis more difficult.

#### Can I make a custom field visible only for specific projects?#

Yes, custom fields can be set to be visible only for specific projects. InProject settings, you can manage which custom fields should be visible and set default values for each project. Additionally, you can choose to make some fields visible only when a user selects a specific project.

#### Can I make certain fields invisible to regular users?#

Yes, you can make certain fieldsinvisibleto regular users while still allowing them to track the data. Invisible fields can be used for metadata, project IDs, or backend integrations. Users won’t see these fields in their Time Tracker or Timesheet, but the data will still be available for reporting and can be used in exports or API integrations.

#### Can required fields be used in reports?#

Yes, required fields can be used inreports. When you export time entries to Excel or CSV, the required fields (and their values) will appear in theDetailed report. This allows you to filter and analyze time entries based on those required fields, ensuring you have consistent and complete data for reporting purposes.

This guide will walk you through how to use these reports, customize them, and export them for deeper analysis.

## Access permissions#

| Workspace admin/owner | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Team manager | X* | X | X |
| Regular user | X** | X | X |

*Team Managercan view reports for their team, but does not have permission to manage reports for the entire workspace.**Regular Usercan only view their own time entries in reports.

## Types of reports in Clockify#

Clockify provides three main types of reports, each serving different purposes based on how you want to analyze your team’s work:

### Summary report#

TheSummary reportis highly flexible and allows you to group your team’s time entries in various ways, depending on your needs. You can group data by:

- Project
- Client
- User
- Group
- Tag
- Month, Week, or Date

How to use theSummary report:

- Group by User: Get a breakdown of your employees’ hours by user, project, and task. This view helps you see how much time each team member spent on specific projects or tasks.
- Group by Date: See how many hours each employee tracked on a specific day. This is ideal if you need a daily, bi-weekly, or monthly report.
- You can select any date range at the top right corner of the report to get a custom view of your team’s hours.

### Weekly report#

TheWeekly reportfocuses on the hours tracked within a set week. It’s helpful for weekly tracking and approval workflows.

How to use theWeekly report:

- Group by User or Project: You can view hours based on individual users or specific projects.
- The report always shows data for one week at a time. However, if you want to see more than one week, you can use theSummary reportand group byUserandDateto see hours per day across weeks.

### Detailed report#

TheDetailed reportprovides a line-by-line view of all time entries for your team, without any grouping or summarization. This report is best for viewing all tracked time in detail and for making adjustments to time entries.

How to use theDetailed report:

- See every time entry recorded by your team
- Admins can edit team members’ time entries directly from theDetailed report
- This report can be exported in various formats, such as PDF, Excel, or CSV

## Manage individual employee reports#

If you need to get data for a single employee, you can filter reports byuserto generate a report specific to that individual’s hours.

Steps to generate an individual employee report:

- Open theSummary report,Detailed report, orWeekly report
- Apply theuser filterto select a specific employee
- View the report for that employee’s hours, and export or analyze the data as needed

## Customize reports#

Clockify’s built-in reports are flexible, but if you need even more customization, you can export theDetailed reportand create customized reports using tools likepivot tablesin Excel or Google Sheets.

To customize reports:

- Export theDetailed reportinCSVformat
- Open the file inExcelorGoogle sheets
- Usepivot tablesor other analysis tools to organize the data in the exact format you need

This is particularly useful if you want to create more complex reports or need to combine data from different sources.

## View and manage Timesheets#

If your workspace is on a paid plan, you can accessTimesheetsfor your employees. This feature provides a summary of each team member’s hours, similar to theWeekly reportbut in a more structured format.

To access and manage Timesheets:

- Go to theTimesheetpage
- Use filters to select a specific employee and group the timesheet byProject
- You can export the timesheet as aPDFfor easy printing or saving

## Current work and tracked time#

You can monitor your team’s real-time activities and check for any discrepancies in tracked time through theDashboard.

To view active timers:

- Navigate to theTeamdashboard
- In theLast activitysection, you’ll see the active timers of all employees
- You can also see who hasn’t tracked time for a specific date range by filtering theTotal trackedcolumn

This is a great way to quickly spot whether team members are meeting their weekly or monthly time goals.

## Notify employees of time tracking issues#

Clockify offers automatic reminders for team members who are under or over their time targets.

Set reminders for employees:

- Set time trackingtargets(e.g. 8 hours per day)
- If someone forgets to log their time, Clockify will send an email reminder
- If an employee exceeds their time target, you, as an Admin, will receive an email notification about the overage

## Troubleshooting#

Sometimes, employees may report tracking time that doesn’t appear in your reports. This is typically caused by them tracking time in a different workspace (such as their personal workspace).

Make sure that employees are tracking their time in the correct workspace. When users create a Clockify account, they are given a personal workspace by default. If they’re working on a team project, they should track time in the workspace you’ve invited them to.

## Export reports#

You can export all types of reports (Summary, Weekly, Detailed) in the following formats:

- PDF
- Excel
- CSV

This is useful for sharing reports with your team, clients, or for archiving purposes.

- Managerreceives notification when a time off request is submitted

#### Can a user edit their own time entry after submission?#

No, users cannot edit their own time entries once submitted. Only Admins and managers with the appropriate permissions can edit or approve time entries. If a user needs changes, they can ask a manager to edit it on their behalf.

#### What should I do if a user claims they submitted a time entry, but I can’t find it?#

Check if the user might have submitted their time in adifferent workspace. Each user has their own personal workspace, and sometimes they may accidentally track time there instead of the correct workspace. As an Admin, you can check their personal workspace to see if the time was logged there.

#### Can I customize the colors for time off requests on the timeline?#

Yes, you can customize the colors for approved, pending, and holiday time off:

- Go to theTime offpolicy settings
- When creating or editing a policy, you can change the colors for approved requests (green), pending requests (orange), and holidays (gray)

#### What happens if I reject a time entry by mistake?#

If you accidentally reject a time entry, you can ask the user to resubmit it. Alternatively, as an Admin, you can manually edit the time entry and approve it again.

Once enabled, you can create time off policies that fit your workspace’s needs.

## Create and manage time off policies#

Time off policies determine how your team can request and track different types of leave, such as vacation days, sick leave, or personal time off.

To create or manage time off policies:

- From the sidebar, click onTime off
- Click on theSettings icon(gear symbol) on the top-right of theTime offpage
- SelectManage policiesto create or edit your time off policies

Key fields to define:

- Assignee: Choose the members who are eligible to request time off under this policy
- Time unit: Define whether the time off is tracked indays(e.g., vacation) orhours(e.g. banked hours)
- Requires approval: Choose whether time off requests require managerial approval. If unchecked, requests will be auto-approved
- Balance expiry:Never expires(default) – Balance for this policy won’t have a start or end date and won’t expire.Has expiry dates– Accrual and every balance for this policy need to have a startand end date defined.
- Never expires(default) – Balance for this policy won’t have a start or end date and won’t expire.
- Has expiry dates– Accrual and every balance for this policy need to have a startand end date defined.
- Automatically accrues: Enable this option to automatically add days or hours to team members’ balances monthly or yearly
- Start/end date– Define timeframe during which defined balance can be used
- Allow negative balance: Allow employees to request time off even if they have a negative balance (e.g. for sick leave). Optionally, limit the amount of negative balance.
- Limit to number of days per period of time– set a limit to a number of days a user can request per defined period
- Reset negative balance– if enabled, Clockify will reset negative balance at the end of the year to automatically clear all negative time off and return the balance to 0 at the end of each yearKeep in mind that new days added to a balance will not automatically clear a negative balance. They will simply be added to the total amount available.Any “leftover” amount will appear as a separate negative balance.
- Allow half day: If time off policy is calculated in days, you can let people ask for a half-day leave, choose the first or second half of a day off, even across multiple days
- Hours: If time off policy is calculated in hours, you can let people ask for multiple hours off across multiple days
- Automatically create time entries: Enable this to automatically track time off requests under the chosen project, including billable hours

## Manage non-working days#

Non-working days (holidays and weekends) can be defined and customized in your workspace settings.

To manage non-working days:

- Go to theTime Offpage.
- Click on theSettings iconand chooseManage Holidays.
- By default,Saturdays and Sundaysare marked as non-working days. You can change this by customizing the working days in theWorkspace settings

- Holiday name: Name your holiday (e.g. New Year’s Day)
- Assigned members: Choose which users or groups are eligible for this holiday
- Annually occurring: Choose whether this holiday should repeat annually
- Holiday color: Select a default color or create a custom color for this holiday

- SelectEditorDeleteEditing allows you to change holiday details like name, assigned users, and colorDeleting will permanently remove the holiday from the system
- Editing allows you to change holiday details like name, assigned users, and color
- Deleting will permanently remove the holiday from the system

When an employee requests time off, holidays and weekends are excluded from the total time off.

For example:If someone requests leave from Jan 1 to Jan 7, and Jan 1 is a holiday, Jan 2 is a Saturday, and Jan 3 is a Sunday, their request will be reduced to 4 days of time off.

## Archive and delete policies#

You can archive or delete outdated policies, such as old vacation policies or specific leave policies no longer in use.

To archive or delete policies:

- Go to theTime offpage
- Click thethree dotsnext to the policy you want to archive or delete

To edit a policy:

- On theTime Offpage, click thethree dotsnext to the policy
- ChooseEditto update the policy name, members, accrual rules, manage time off balance or other details

### Manage time off balance

Clockify also allows you to manage when and how time off balances can be used by your team members.

- Go toTime offpage and openManage policiesinSettings
- ClickEditnext to the policy you want to change
- Go to theBalance expirysection and choose one of two options:Never expires(default)Balance doesn’t have expiry dateHas expiry datesAll future accruals and balances for this policy require definedstartandenddate
- Never expires(default)Balance doesn’t have expiry date
- Has expiry datesAll future accruals and balances for this policy require definedstartandenddate

Important to note:

- If you switch policy toNever expires, all existing start and end dates on user balances will be removed
- If you switch policy toHas expiry dates, all existing balances get a start date of today and all future balances will require a start and end date

When a user requests time off, Clockify always deducts days from the balance that is expiring soonest.

### Delete time off policy#

To delete a policy:

- Follow the same steps as for editing a policy
- After archiving, selectDeleteto permanently remove the policy from the system

# [ARTICLE] I can’t find my time entries
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/cant-find-entries

In this article

- You’re logged into the wrong workspace
- You are viewing the wrong date range
- You are logged into a different account
- Your time entries were deleted by an admin

If your time entries aren’t showing up, there could be a few different reasons behind it. Here’s how to check what might be happening and how to get your entries to show correctly.

## You’re logged into the wrong workspace#

Your time entries are tied to the workspace where you tracked them. If you are in a different workspace, you won’t see them.

What to do:

- Click on the workspace switcher in the top-left corner
- Switch to other available workspaces and check the Time Tracker or Reports

Your tracked time may be in a personal workspace or another team workspace.

## You are viewing the wrong date range#

The entries may exist but be outside of the currently selected date range.

What to do:

- Navigate to the Reports page (Summary or Detailed)
- Check and adjust the date range via the calendar to include relevant dates

This is especially common when reviewing older or future time entries.

Reports always default to a weekly view.

## You are logged into a different account#

If you have multiple Clockify accounts with different email addresses, your time entries may be in another account entirely.

What to do:

- Make sure you’re logged in with the same email address used to create or join the workspace
- If you are not sure, check all your email inboxes for Clockify-related messages
- If you’re part of a company workspace, ask an admin to confirm which email is tied to your profile on the Team page

If you’re signed in using an Apple ID with Private Relay, your account may use a private, anonymized email address (e.g.,random@privaterelay.appleid.com). In that case, make sure you’re using the “Continue with Apple” option instead of trying to log in manually.

## Your time entries were deleted by an admin#

Admins have permission to delete time entries submitted by other users. If you’re a regular user, this might be the reason they’re missing.

What to do:

- Contact your workspace admin to check if the entries were removed
- If they were, and if your permissions allow it, you can enter time retroactively by changing the date on the Time Tracker page

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us atsupport@clockify.meand provide us with the following information:

- Your email address
- A screenshot of your Time Tracker or Timesheet
- Your role in the workspace
- The date range and any relevant project or task names


# [ARTICLE] I can’t find my workspace
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/cant-find-workspace

In this article

- You’re logged in with the wrong email address
- You have multiple workspaces under the same account
- You’ve been removed from the workspace

If your workspace seems to have disappeared, don’t worry; in most cases, it’s tied to your login details or workspace membership. This guide will help you check the most common causes and walk you through how to get back into your workspace quickly.

## You’re logged in with the wrong email address#

Each Clockify account is tied to a specific email address. If you’re logged into a different account than the one used to join or create a workspace, you won’t see it listed.

What to do:

- Double-check which email you’re currently logged in with
- If you’re not sure which email you used for your workspace:Check your email inboxes for any Clockify-related messages (e.g., invites, reports, etc.)If you are part of a company workspace, ask your workspace admin to check your email address via the Team page
- Check your email inboxes for any Clockify-related messages (e.g., invites, reports, etc.)
- If you are part of a company workspace, ask your workspace admin to check your email address via the Team page

Using Apple ID?

- If you logged in or created an account using the “Continue with Apple” option, your account might be using Apple’s Private Relay feature, which generates a private, anonymized email (e.g.,random@privatereplay.appleid.com).
- If you try to log in later using your real email address, it may not work because that email isn’t linked to your Clockify account.

Make sure you’re logging in with the same method you originally used (e.g., Continue with Apple, not manual login).

## You have multiple workspaces under the same account#

If you’re logged in with the right email address but still can’t find your workspace, it’s possible you have multiple workspaces and the wrong one is currently active.

To switch to another workspace:

- Click on the workspace switcher located in the upper left corner of the screen
- Browse through the list of workspaces to see if your missing workspace is listed here

## You’ve been removed from the workspace#

If you’ve been removed from the workspace, you’ll be automatically logged out of it and redirected to your personal workspace.

To check:

- Open the notification bell (top-right corner)
- Look for a message: “You’ve been removed from the workspace.”

If that’s the case, reach out to your admin to be re-invited.

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us atsupport@clockify.meand provide us with the following information:

- The email address you’re currently logged in with
- The name of the workspace you’re trying to access

- Make sure that you haven’t already accepted the invitation and created an account
- The invite expired
- Steps for the admins of the account

If you get the message that the invitation link has expired when you try to accept it, here are the steps you can take.

## Make sure that you haven’t already accepted the invitation and created an account#

If you’ve accepted the invitation via the link already, it will automatically become invalid, and you won’t be able to log into your workspace via it.

To check this:

- Navigate to the clockify.me
- Enter your credentials (email and verification code)
- Log in

If you already have an account, you can accept the pending invite via the notification center, which is located under the bell icon.

## The invite expired#

Invitation links expire after 14 days, so if you haven’t accepted one during that time, the account admin will need to provide you with a new one.

## Steps for the admins of the account#

Here’s how you can resend the invite:

- Navigate to the team page
- Click on the three dots next to the user who has the ‘not joined yet’ tag
- Select the ‘send an invite email’ option

Alternatively, you can remove the user completely from your account and add them again by following these steps:

# [ARTICLE] I can’t see my team members’ time
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/cant-see-time

In this article

- Verify the date range
- Verify that the team member is tracking time in your workspace
- Confirm that they are invited to your workspace
- Review permissions

If you can’t see your team member’s tracked time in reports, try the following steps:

## Verify the date range#

By default, the date range on all reports is set to “This week”, so you might be missing time tracked on other dates. Here’s how to check that:

- Select the calendar icon located in the upper right corner
- Choose a date range from the presets on the side, like “Last week”, “This month,” or select a custom date range by clicking on the start and ending dates
- Check if the time entries now appear

This helps ensure that you’re not filtering out relevant data by accident.

## Verify that the team member is tracking time in your workspace#

Team members can belong to multiple workspaces, including their own personal one. If you’re not seeing their time in reports, it’s possible they’re tracking time in a different workspace.

To fix this, ask your team member to confirm they are tracking time in your shared workspace, not their personal one. Here’s how they can check that:

- Click on the workspace switcher located in the upper left corner
- Check how many workspaces you have in the dropdown menu
- Make sure that you’re logged into the shared workspace

Each workspace is treated separately, so if a team member is tracking time in their personal workspace, you won’t be able to see that data in your shared workspace.

## Confirm that they are invited to your workspace#

Make sure that the team member is actually invited to the workspace and is an active member of it.

- Navigate to the team page
- Find the user in question
- Make sure that they are active
- If they have the “Not joined yet” tag next to their name, it means that they haven’t accepted the invitation, in which case, you can resend it by clicking on the three dots next to their name

## Review permissions#

If you are still unable to see the time entries, make sure that you have the right permissions to do so.

Access to time entries depends on your role in the workspace:

- Admins can see all time entries
- Project Managers can see time entries only for users tracking time on their projectsAsk an admin to confirm the team member is assigned to your projects
- Ask an admin to confirm the team member is assigned to your projects
- Team Managers can only see users within their assigned teamAsk an admin to verify that the person you’re trying to view is a part of your team
- Ask an admin to verify that the person you’re trying to view is a part of your team

# [ARTICLE] Time and amounts mismatch in reports
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/time-mismatch

In this article

- Compact mode is enabled
- Rate hierarchy affects calculations
- Discrepancy in Excel report

If you’re noticing a mismatch in your reports, here are a few common reasons why that happens:

## Compact mode is enabled#

- In Compact Mode, each time entry is automatically rounded to the nearest full minute for display purposes only
- This does not affect the actual tracked time; the system always stores time in the full format
- To view the exact time format:
- Navigate to the workspace settings by clicking on the three dots next to your workspace name
- Under the “Duration Format” drop-down, select “Full”

Once you switch to the full format, your reports will show you the most accurate data without rounding.

## Rate hierarchy affects calculations#

Billing amounts may differ depending on how rates are applied. In Clockify, a more specific rate overrides a less specific one in this order:

Project’s member rate > Task rate > Project rate > Member rate > Workspace rate

- How to check which rates are applied

To identify where a rate is coming from, you can check each level in the rate hierarchy:

Project Member Rate

- Go to the Projects page and open the relevant project
- Navigate to the Team tab inside the project
- Check the rate column for each team member

Task Rate

- While still inside the project, navigate to the Tasks tab
- Check the rate column for each task

Project Rate

- Navigate to the Settings tab inside a project
- Scroll a bit down and check the rate

Team Member Rate

- Navigate to the Team tab located on the sidebar
- Check the rate for each team member under the rate column

Workspace Rate

- Click on the three dots next to the workspace name
- Click on the ‘Workspace Settings’ option
- Scroll down and check the workspace rate

You can edit the rates by selecting the ‘Change’ button located next to each hourly rate. If you are on a paid plan, you’ll have an option to apply the rate retroactively by selecting the ‘Apply to all future and past time entries’ option.

## Discrepancy in Excel report#

If you’re seeing small differences in totals when exporting reports to Excel, this is due to how decimals are handled:

- The web app and PDF exports calculate the amounts using 4 decimal places, which ensures precise totals, especially when time is multiplied by hourly rates.
- When exporting to Excel, the data is sent with only 2 decimal places for display and compatibility reasons
- If you use Excel’s SUM formula, the totals may be slightly off due to rounding at the line-item level

Example:

A time entry amount of $33.3368 might appear as $33.34 in Excel. When summed across multiple entries, those small differences can add up.

For the most accurate values:

- Rely on the web report or PDF export, which reflects the true calculation using full decimal precision.
- Use Excel exports primarily for raw data or basic overviews

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us at support@clockify.me and include the following details:

- A screenshot of the discrepancy in question
- A CSV copy of the report for the relevant date range
- Billable rate information


# [ARTICLE] How to view the time of inactive team members?
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/inactive-team-members

You can still view the time tracked by team members who are no longer active in your workspace.

If the team member is deactivated:

- Go to any report (Summary or Detailed)
- Open the Team filter
- Select “Inactive” to include deactivated users
- Find the team member by name to view their time entries

If the team member is deleted:

- Go to the Summary report
- Use the Group by -> User option
- Scroll through the grouped list and find users as DeletedUser
- Click on it to open a Detailed report where you can see all their time entries

If you delete a user completely from your organization, their name will no longer appear in reports or entries. They’ll be listed as DeletedUser. To preserve historical data while still freeing up their seat, we recommend deactivating the user instead of deleting them.


# [ARTICLE] I can’t edit time entries on a detailed report
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/cant-edit-time

In this article

- For Admins
- For Regular Users

If you are unable to edit time entries on a detailed report, the cause might depend on your role in the workspace or because the time entry has already been approved.

To check which role you’ve been assigned to:

- Navigate to the Team page from the sidebar
- Look for your name on the list
- Check your role under the “Role” column

If you see the “+ role” sign next to your name, that would indicate that you’re a regular team member in the workspace.

If you do not have access to the team page, contact your admin.

## For Admins#

If you are an admin and cannot edit a time entry:

- Check if the time entry has been approved
- Approved time entries show a green checkmark and appear grayed out
- These entries are locked from editing, even for admins

If this is the case, you’ll need to withdraw the timesheet in question and then make edits. Here’s how:

- Go to the Approvals tab
- Switch to the Archive tab
- Find and open the relevant timesheet
- Click Withdraw in the upper right corner
- Return to the detailed report to make changes

This action withdraws the entire timesheet, so after you make the changes, be sure to submit and approve it again.

## For Regular Users#

If you are a regular (non-admin) user and can’t edit time entries:

- The Force Timer feature may be enabled (this prevents manual editing)
- Time entries may be locked globally in the workspace settings
- In both cases, you’ll need to contact an admin to make changes on your behalf or unlock the time entries

# [ARTICLE] Overlapping time entries
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/overlapping-entries

In this article

- Why do overlapping time entries happen
- Recommended solution: Enable Force Timer

Overlapping time entries are expected behavior in Clockify unless the Force Timer feature is enabled. If the system were designed to prevent overlapping time entries, it would need to block users from adding time during already-tracked periods or automatically adjust overlapping entries.

## Why do overlapping time entries happen#

There are two main ways users can create overlapping time entries:

- Simultaneous use of manual entry and a timer

Users may manually log time while also running a timer without properly coordinating start and end times. This often results in entries that unintentionally overlap.

2. Manual durations without precise timing

Instead of specifying exact start and end times, users may enter total durations (e.g., “2 hours”), which can overlap with existing time entries if they don’t verify the timeframes.

Common scenarios

- A user starts a timer at 10:00 AM, then later manually logs time from 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM.
- A user stops one timer and immediately starts another one (overlap happens here, usually with the compact mode enabled)
- Multiple time entries are created with overlapping durations because users are unaware of existing entries

## Recommended solution: Enable Force Timer#

To prevent overlapping time entries, we recommend enabling the Force Timer feature.

What Force Timer feature does:

- Prevents manual time entry—users can only track time using the timer
- Ensures no overlaps—since time must be tracked in real time, overlapping entries are automatically avoided
- Keeps data clean—Your reports, calendars, and logs will be consistent and reliable

How to enable Force Timer

- Click on the three dots next to your workspace name
- Select “Workspace settings” from the drop-down menu
- Navigate to the “Permissions” tab
- Scroll down to the bottom of the page and enable the Force Timer feature

The Force Timer feature is a workspace-wide setting and will apply to all users. This feature is available on our PRO and Enterprise plans.

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us atsupport@clockify.meand include the following details:

- A screenshot of the time entries in question from the detailed report
- Information on whether the Force Timer feature is enabled in your workspace
- Information about your current duration format


# [ARTICLE] The third filter after Description is missing
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/third-filter

In this article

- Why this happens
- Recommended solution

The summary report allows up to three grouping filters. However:

- You won’t be able to use Description as the first grouping filter
- If you select Description as the second filter, the third option becomes unavailable

## Why this happens#

Description represents the lowest data level in the hierarchy. Since it’s attached to each time entry individually, it doesn’t group or summarize data; there is nothing meaningful to break down further, which is why additional grouping isn’t allowed after it.

## Recommended solution#

Always use Description as the third filter when grouping data in the Summary Report. This keeps the report structured and ensures all grouping levels function correctly.


# [ARTICLE] I can’t stop the timer
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/cant-stop-the-timer

In this article

- Check if any required fields are missing
- Long-running timer
- Device time is not synced

If you are having trouble stopping a running timer, it’s usually because something is missing or restricted.

## Check if any required fields are missing#

If your workspace requires fields like a project, task, or a description, the timer won’t stop until you add that info.

- Open the Time Tracker page
- Look for fields marked with a red asterisk
- Enter the missing details
- Try stopping the timer again

## Long-running timer#

If your timer has been running for a long time (e.g., overnight) and your workspace has the lock timesheets feature enabled, this can prevent you from stopping the running timer.

- Check the total duration of the time entry
- If the timer crosses into a locked day (e.g., longer than 10 hours), you won’t be able to stop it
- Ask your workspace admin to adjust or unlock the timesheet, or you can discard the timer

## Device time is not synced#

If your device’s time isn’t synced correctly, it can prevent the timer from stopping.

Clockify stores time entries in UTC to keep data consistent across all users and locations. If your device time, browser settings, and actual time zone don’t match, Clockify might not be able to calculate the time duration correctly.

Example:

If you start a timer while your device is set to GMT+2 and later your system switches to GMT+0 (or is incorrect), Clockify will see the stop time asbeforethe start time and prevent you from saving it.

- Visittime.isto check if your device time matches the real time
- If it’s off, update your device time settings to sync automatically with your time zone
- Try stopping the timer again

How to check and correct your time settings

On Windows:

- Click the Start menu and open Settings
- Go to Time & Language > Date & Time
- Toggle “Set time automatically” and “Set time zone automatically” to On
- If needed, manually select the correct time zone
- Restart your browser and refresh Clockify

On macOS:

- Open System Settings (or System Preferences on older versions)
- Go to General > Date & Time
- Enable Set time and date automatically
- Turn on Set time zone automatically using current location if available
- Restart your browser and refresh Clockify

Still not working?

- Refresh your browser
- Log out and log back in
- Try using a different browser or incognito mode

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us atsupport@clockify.meand provide us with the following information:

# [ARTICLE] I can’t add time
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/cant-add-time

In this article

- The “Force Timer” feature is enabled
- The “Lock Timesheets” feature is enabled
- Device time is not synced

If you are unable to add time, there are a few things you can check to fix the issue.

## The “Force Timer” feature is enabled#

When Force Timer is turned on, you can only track time using the timer; manual entries are disabled.

- If you see an error message ‘Manual time tracking is disabled’, this might be the cause
- You’ll need to use the timer instead, or ask your workspace admin to disable Force Timer

How to find the admin of a workspace:

- Navigate to the Team tab
- Look for a user with an Admin role assigned

## The “Lock Timesheets” feature is enabled#

If the Lock Timesheets is enabled in the workspace settings, you won’t be able to edit the time for locked dates.

- You’ll see a message saying the date is locked on the timesheet
- You won’t be able to select that particular date on the Time Tracker page, as it will be grayed out

In this case, ask your workspace admin to:

- Add the time manually for you, or
- Temporarily disable Lock Timesheets so you can enter it yourself

## Device time is not synced#

If your device clock isn’t synced with real time, the system may prevent you from adding time.

- Visittime.isto check if your device time is accurate
- If it’s off, update your device’s clock
- Try adding time again

For workspace admins

If your team reports they can’t add time manually:

- Click on the three dots next to your workspace name and select “Workspace Settings.”
- Navigate to the Permissions tab
- Scroll all the way down and check if the Force Timer and Lock Timesheet features are enabled
- Disable the features if needed

To add time for your team members:

# [ARTICLE] I can’t see a project or task in the project picker
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/cant-see-a-project

In this article

- Project visibility
- The project is archived or deleted
- Expected behavior in the Timesheet view

If a project or a task is missing from the drop-down, it’s usually due to access settings or changes to the project status.

The available options may differ depending on your workspace role (e.g., regular user or admin). Refer to the steps below based on your permissions.

## Project visibility#

If a project is set to private, only users added under the Access tab can see it.

- Contact your admin or project manager to confirm your access (you can find them on the Team page and check their roles in the “Role” column)
- Once added, the project will appear in your picker

If your team member reports an issue, you can:

- Go to the Projects page from the sidebar
- Click on the project to open it
- Navigate to the Access tab
- Check if the project is Private or Public
- If set to Private, make sure the user is added under the Users section

## The project is archived or deleted#

Archived or deleted projects won’t appear in the project picker.

- Ask your admin to check if the project is inactive or deleted

For admins:

- Go to the Projects page
- Use the filter to view Archived projects
- Find and restore the project if needed by clicking on the three dots

Deleted projects can’t be searched, but time entries linked to them will still show up in the Detailed Report, usually with the “+ Project” sign.

## Expected behavior in the Timesheet view#

In the Timesheet view, each project can only be selected once per week. It won’t show up again in the project picker for new rows.

- If you’ve already added a project (e.g., Project A), use the same row to enter time across the week
- This setup is intended for quick weekly time input, but you can still add multiple time entries on the same day for one project via the Time Tracker page

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us atsupport@clockify.meand provide us with the following information:

https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/cant-edit-team-time

In this article

- Workspace role
- The Force Timer or Lock Timesheets features are enabled
- Time entry has been approved

If you are unable to edit someone’s time entry, it’s usually due to workspace settings or approved time entries.

## Workspace role#

Make sure that you have the correct role assigned in the workspace. As per the current design:

- Admins can edit time entries for everyone
- Team Managers can only edit the time for users they manage if enabled in the Workspace Settings
- Project Managers can’t edit time for others

You can check your role via the Team page. If you do not have access to the Team page, contact your admin.

## The Force Timer or Lock Timesheets features are enabled#

If you’ve enabled the Force Timer or Lock Timesheets feature, as an admin, you can still edit time for other team members via the Detailed Report. However, if the Force Timer is enabled, you won’t be able to make changes via the Timesheet.

Here’s how to do it on the Detailed Report:

- Navigate to the Detailed report
- Select a date range from the calendar
- Select a team member from the “Team” filter and apply it
- Find the entry you’d like to edit and make changes in the designated fields

## Time entry has been approved#

Approved time entries are locked and can’t be edited by anyone, including admins.

- Approved time entries will have a green check mark in the Detailed report and Timesheet
- To edit them, the timesheet will need to be withdrawn

To withdraw a timesheet:

- Navigate to the Approvals tab from the sidebar
- Find the relevant timesheet under the Archive tab
- Click to open it and select “Withdraw” in the upper right corner
- Go back to the Detailed report and make the changes

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us atsupport@clockify.meand provide us with the following information:

# [ARTICLE] Description field missing in the Timesheet
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/description-field-missing

In the Timesheet view, you won’t see the description field by default. This view is designed for fast time input across the week.

But you can still add a description (and more details) after creating an entry. Here’s how:

Add your time normally

- Select a project and a task
- Enter your hours directly into the timesheet cells

Click on the three dots in the cell

- Once the entry is created, click on the three dots in the cell
- A detailed pop-up will open

Add your description and other details

In the pop-up window, you can:

- Add a description
- Set start and end times
- Add tags
- Add other time entry details

Descriptions are linked to individual time entries. If you enter the same project across multiple rows, you’ll need to add a description to each entry separately if needed. If you prefer to add a description while creating the entry, use the Time Tracker page instead.


# [ARTICLE] I can’t copy last week in the Timesheet
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/cant-copy-last-week

In this article

- The approval period is not set to weekly
- The timesheet for the previous week is blank
- The current week already has time entries

The Copy Last Week option in the Timesheet view lets you quickly duplicate projects and tasks with or without hours from the previous week. If the option is grayed out or not working, here’s what might be causing it.

## The approval period is not set to weekly#

The Copy Last Week feature only works when your workspace uses a weekly approval period. If the approval range is set to semi-monthly or monthly, the button will be grayed out.

Here’s how to check the approval period:

- Click on the three dots next to your workspace name and select “Workspace Settings”
- Scroll down until you see the “Approvals” feature
- Check the approval period

If you are a regular user in the workspace, ask your admin to review the approval period under Workspace Settings.

This behavior applies to timesheet templates as well. You can create and apply them only if the approval period has been set to “Weekly”.

## The timesheet for the previous week is blank#

If you didn’t track any time during the previous week, there’s nothing to copy.

- At least one time entry must be present in last week’s timesheet
- The button won’t appear if the previous week is empty
- You can check last week’s time by clicking on the back arrow on the calendar icon

## The current week already has time entries#

The Copy Last Week option only works if your current week is completely empty.

- If you’ve already added time even to one cell, the button will be grayed out
- Clear all time entries for the current week if you want to copy a previous one

If you see a message that some time entries couldn’t be copied, it’s likely because one or more projects or tasks have been archived or deleted since last week. You can check that on the Projects page by using the “Archived” filter.

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us at support@clockify.me and include the following details:

- A screenshot of your current timesheet
- Information about the Approval period (if enabled)
- A screenshot of the previous week’s time entries


# [ARTICLE] Timesheet discrepancy
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/timesheet-discrepancy

In this article

- Why this happens
- How to resolve the discrepancy

If you are seeing differences between your team member’s timesheet and what you see as an admin, it’s likely due to time zone differences in profile settings. Here’s why this happens and how to resolve it.

## Why this happens#

- Clockify stores all time entries in UTC on the servers. What each user sees in the browser application is based on the time zone set in their profile settings.
- If a team member is in a different timezone than you, their time entries may appear to be on a different day or at different hours when you view them from your account.
- This doesn’t mean the data is incorrect; it’s just being displayed relative to each person’s local time.

## How to resolve the discrepancy#

- Ask your team member to go to the “Preferences” settings under their profile
- Have them change their time zone to match yours
- Refresh the page to compare again

Once time zones are aligned, you will see matching times and dates for entries on the timesheet.

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us at support@clockify.me and include the following details:

- Your time zone and the team member’s time zone
- A screenshot from both views (if possible)
- Affected date or time range when the discrepancy appears

- The user is also an admin
- How to deactivate a team member
- The user hasn’t joined yet

If you are trying to deactivate someone from your team but the option isn’t available, it’s likely due to role permissions or the user’s account status. Here’s what to check.

## The user is also an admin#

Admins cannot deactivate other admins; only the workspace owner has the permission to do this.

- If you are an admin and the user you’re trying to remove also has an admin role, the option will not appear
- To proceed, contact the workspace owner and ask them to deactivate the user

- Navigate to the Team page from the sidebar
- Find the user you’d like to deactivate
- Click on the three dots on the right-hand side
- Select “Deactivate.”

This will remove the user’s access but retain all their time entries in the system.

## The user hasn’t joined yet#

If the user has a “Not joined yet” tag, they can’t be removed from the team page. Instead, you’ll need to delete them from theCAKE.comaccount. Here’s how:

- Click on your profile picture and select “ManageCAKE.comaccount”
- Click on the back arrow and select “My Account”
- Click on “Members” from the sidebar
- Find the user you’d like to remove and click on their name to expand the details
- Click on the three dots under the “Workspaces” section

# [ARTICLE] Holiday entry not created
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/holiday-entry-not-created

In this article

- Time entries are not set to be created automatically
- The Holiday is not assigned to the team member

If a holiday time entry isn’t appearing in your reports, it’s usually due to one of the following reasons.

## Time entries are not set to be created automatically#

If this option in the holiday settings is disabled, you won’t see any time entries for that date.

To check that:

- Go to the Time Off page
- Click on the “Cog” icon and select “Manage Holidays”.
- Click on the three dots next to the Holiday policy in question
- Check if the “Automatically create time entries” option is enabled

## The Holiday is not assigned to the team member#

If a team member does not see the entry, or you do not see them in the reports, they may not be included in the holiday policy.

- Go to the Time Off page
- Click on the “Cog” icon and select “Manage Holidays”
- Click on the three dots next to the Holiday policy in question
- Check if the team member has been assigned to the policy under the “Assignees” menu

Holiday entries are created on the date of the holiday, not in advance or retroactively. If you’re checking before or after the holiday has passed, the entry won’t appear unless the holiday was set up properly ahead of time.

# [ARTICLE] Time off entry issues
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/time-off-entry-issues

In this article

- Time off entries are not created
- Time off entries are shorter than 8 hours

Here are common issues that may arise when time off entries do not appear as expected or show incorrect values.

## Time off entries are not created#

If you do not see any time entries after an approved time off request, there are a few common reasons:

- The automatic creation setting is disabled in the policy
- The request is still pending and hasn’t been approved
- The date range you’re viewing doesn’t include the requested time off

The time-off entry is only created in the system on the day of the requested absence. It will not be visible in reports prior to that date.

Check if the request is still pending (approvers only):

- Navigate to the Time Off page
- Click on the “Requests” tab
- Look for a “Pending” tag next to the request

If the request is pending, approve it first. The time entry will be created automatically afterward (if the policy allows it).

Check the date range:

Before checking the policy settings, make sure you’re looking at the correct date range in your reports. Time off entries will only show if the requested date is included in the current view.

To check the date range:

- Open the Reports page (Summary or Detailed)
- Click on the Calendar icon and select a date range

Check the policy settings, and if the “Automatically create time off entries” option is enabled:

- Navigate to the Time Off page
- Click on the Cog icon and select “Manage policies”
- Click on the three dots next to the policy and select “Edit”
- Check if the option is enabled

If the “Automatically create time entries” option has been disabled on that specific policy, once you enable it, time entries will not be created retroactively. Clockify will create time entries for requests made after the setting is enabled.

## Time off entries are shorter than 8 hours#

If the time off entries are shorter than expected, it’s probably because the user’s working hours are set to 7 hours or less on the Team page.

To check that:

- Navigate to the Team page from the sidebar
- Click on the three dots next to the team member and select “Edit”
- Check their working hours

Time off entries always match the team member’s working hours.

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us atsupport@clockify.meand include the following details:

- A screenshot of the Time Off policy settings
- A screenshot of the Time Off request status (Pending or Approved)

In this article

- The user is not assigned to the time off policy
- The user does not have sufficient time off balance

If a team member is unable to submit a time off request, here are the most common reasons and how to resolve them.

## The user is not assigned to the time off policy#

If a user is not assigned to any time off policy, they won’t be able to request time off.

Admins can check this by following the steps below:

- Navigate to the Time Off page
- Click on the Cog icon and select “Manage policies”
- Click on the three dots and select “Edit”
- Make sure that the user is listed under the “Assignees” menu

## The user does not have sufficient time off balance#

Even if a user is assigned to the policy, they won’t be able to request time off if their balance is zero.

To check their balance:

- Navigate to the Time Off page from the sidebar
- Click on the Balance tab
- Filter by User or Policy to view the available balance

If they don’t have enough balance:

- Add to their balance manually by clicking on the three dots
- Or, go to the policy settings and enable “Allow negative balance” to let users request time off even if they don’t have enough available days

# [ARTICLE] Time off notification issues
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/time-off-notification-issues

In this article

- Time off email notifications are turned off in preferences
- You are not assigned as the approver in the policy
- You are a Team Manager, but the requester is not under your management
- Admins are not notified when Team Managers are the assigned approvers

If you are not receiving time off request notifications, it’s usually due to your notification preferences or your role in the approval process.

## Time off email notifications are turned off in preferences#

Even if everything else is set up correctly, you won’t receive email notifications if you’ve disabled time off notifications in your own settings.

To check this:

- Click on your Profile picture in the top right corner and select “Preferences”
- Navigate to the “Email notifications” tab
- Make sure that the “Time off” checkbox is enabled

If this is turned off, no notifications will be sent, even if you’re listed as an approver.

## You are not assigned as the approver in the policy#

You’ll only receive notifications if you’re listed as an approver in the Time Off policy settings.

To check:

- Navigate to the Time Off page from the sidebar
- Click on the cog icon and select “Manage Policies”
- Click on the three dots next to the Policy and select “Edit”
- Under “Who can approve” check if the approver is set to:
- An Admin
- A Team Manager
- A Specific Member added to the approver list

## You are a Team Manager, but the requester is not under your management#

Being a Team Manager doesn’t guarantee that you’ll receive notifications. You’ll only be notified if the user requesting time off is part of your team.

To confirm:

- Navigate to the Team page from the sidebar
- Click on your role
- Check whether the user in question is listed under your management

## Admins are not notified when Team Managers are the assigned approvers#

If the Time Off policy is set so that Team Managers can approve requests, then Admins will not receive notifications, even if they are Admins at the workspace level.

If you are an Admin and want to be notified:

- Assign yourself as a Team Manager to the users or teams you’re responsible for via the Team page

# [ARTICLE] CSV File import issues
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/file-import-issues

In this article

- Required headers are missing or incorrect
- Date, time, and duration formats don’t match Clockify settings
- Excel formatting issues
- The file is not comma-delimited
- Missing or incomplete field values

If your CSV file fails to import into Clockify, it’s usually due to formatting issues or missing required data. Below are the most common reasons why imports fail and how to fix them.

## Required headers are missing or incorrect#

Your CSV file must include the following required column headers, written in English.

- Project
- Client
- User
- Email
- Task
- Tag
- Start date
- Start time
- Duration

You can find the full list of supported columnshere.

Headers must be spelled correctly in English, free of extra spaces or characters. If any of these are missing or incorrectly formatted, your import will fail.

## Date, time, and duration formats don’t match Clockify settings#

Clockify reads your CSV file based on your account and workspace formatting settings. The start date, start time, and duration fields must follow these settings.

Date and time format:

- Click on your profile picture in the upper right corner
- Select “Preferences.”
- Under the General tab, check your Date and Time formats

Duration format:

- Click on the three dots next to your workspace name
- Click on the “Workspace settings”
- Under the General tab, check the Duration format:
- Decimal
- Full
- Compact

Your CSV file must match these formats exactly; otherwise, the file will be rejected.

## Excel formatting issues#

If you opened or edited your CSV file in Excel, it might have changed the formatting (e.g., dates, times, or stripped leading zeroes). This often breaks the import.

To prevent that, we recommend opening and editing your CSV file in Google Sheets, which maintains correct formatting.

## The file is not comma-delimited#

Clockify expects CSV files to use commas as delimiters. If your file uses semicolons instead, the import will not work.

How to check if your file is comma-delimited:

- Open the CSV file in a plain text editor (like Notepad)
- Check the character separating values:
- If values are separated by commas, the format is correct
- If you see semicolons (;), you’ll need to convert the delimiters to commas.

You can also open the file in Google Sheets and re-download it as CSV. Google Sheets will automatically format it correctly using commas as delimiters.

## Missing or incomplete field values#

Even if all required fields are present, your import can still fail if some fields are left empty in your CSV file.

Check your workspace required field settings:

- Click on the three dots next to your workspace name
- Select “Workspace settings”
- At the top of the page, check if the Timesheet is enabled. If it is, Project becomes a required field by default
- Scroll down to the “Do not allow saving time without” section to see if additional fields (e.g., Description, Task, Tag) are marked as required.

If any of these required fields are empty in your CSV, the import will not succeed.

Custom fields:

If your workspace requires custom fields, you must also include those in your CSV, with valid data for each entry.

To streamline the import process:

- Temporarily disable all required fields in your workspace settings
- Import only the essential time entry data
- After the import, re-enable your required fields

This approach saves time and avoids needing to populate every single field in advance.

# [ARTICLE] Managing workspaces in Clockify
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/managing-workspaces

In this article

- Switching workspaces
- Creating a new workspace
- Deleting or leaving a workspace

Workspaces help you organize teams, projects, and data separately within Clockify. Whether you’re a part of one or multiple workspaces, you can manage them directly in Clockify or through yourCAKE.comaccount. Below are the most common workspace-related actions and how to handle them depending on your role and permissions.

## Switching workspaces#

You can switch between workspaces using the workspace switcher in the upper-left corner of the screen.

When you click on it, you’ll see a list of all the workspaces connected to your account. Just select the one you want to switch to.

If you don’t see any additional workspaces but you know you’ve been invited or created them before, make sure you’re logged in with the correct email address. It’s possible that you’ve logged in using a different account.

You can also switch workspaces via theCAKE.comaccount. Here’s how:

- Log in to yourCAKE.comaccount
- Navigate to the “Workspaces” section
- Click on the three dots next to the workspace name
- Select “Open in Clockify”

You can also access your Pumble and Plaky workspaces from this section, making it easy to switch between all your apps in one place.

## Creating a new workspace#

To create a new workspace:

- Click on the three dots next to your workspace name
- Select “Manage workspaces”
- You’ll be redirected to theCAKE.comaccount, where you can click on the “Create workspace” button

Only the owner of the organization can create new workspaces. If you’re a regular user, you’ll need to create a new account under a different email address to start a new workspace.

## Deleting or leaving a workspace#

Only owners can delete a workspace.

To delete:

- Click on the three dots next to your workspace name
- Select “Manage workspaces”
- Click on the three dots next to the workspace you’d like to delete

- Click on the “Leave organization” button
- Confirm your decision


# [ARTICLE] Can I merge workspaces?
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/merge-workspaces

In this article

- How to move data between workspaces

Each workspace is treated as a separate entity with its own users, projects, and data. This means there’s no built-in option to directly combine two or more workspaces into one.

However, if you’d like to move data from one workspace to another, you can do so manually by exporting and importing data using CSV files.

## How to move data between workspaces#

In the workspace you want to move data from, go to the Detailed report and export the data to a CSV file

- This file includes time entries, projects, tasks, clients, and more
- Before exporting, make sure to select the correct date range from the calendar
- Navigate to the Detailed report
- Select a date range from the calendar
- Apply filters (optional)
- Export to CSV
- If you are on a paid plan, you can select a custom date range that spans multiple years
- If you’re on a free plan, you’ll need to export data year by year

In the workspace you want to move data to, use the CSV import feature to upload the file

To import your CSV file:

- Click on the three dots next to your workspace name
- Select “Workspace settings”
- Go to the “Import” tab
- Click “Upload CSV file” and select your exported file from the file browser

Importing data is only available on paid plans. Only time entry data and related metadata (projects, clients, etc.) will be imported. Workspace settings, roles, access, etc., will not carry over.

# [ARTICLE] Submit timesheet email not received
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/submit-timesheet-email

In this article

- Approval role is not assigned correctly
- Email notifications for timesheet approvals are disabled
- Timesheet has not been submitted

If you’re expecting a submit timesheet email notification and it’s not showing up, there may be a few settings or role assignments preventing it from being delivered. Here’s how to check what might be causing the issue and how to resolve it.

## Approval role is not assigned correctly#

Even if you’re an admin, you won’t receive email notifications unless you’re explicitly assigned a Project Manager or Team Manager role, depending on the approval settings in your workspace.

What to do:

- Navigate to the Team page from the sidebar
- Click on your role title under the “Role” column
- Assign yourself a Team Manager or Project Manager, depending on who is set to approve timesheets in your workspace

Admins can verify the current approval settings by following the steps below:

- Click on the three dots next to your workspace name
- Select “Workspace settings.”
- Navigate to the “Permissions” tab
- Check who is allowed to approve timesheets (Admins and PMs / Admins and TMs)

Team Managers and Project Managers will only receive email notifications if the workspace settings allow it. If your workspace is set to allow only Admins and Project Managers to approve timesheets, Team Managers won’t receive any notifications.

## Email notifications for timesheet approvals are disabled#

If the correct role is assigned but no emails are received, it’s possible that timesheet email notifications are turned off in profile preferences.

To verify:

- Click on your profile picture in the upper right corner and select “Preferences”
- Navigate to the Email Notifications tab
- Ensure the Approval option is enabled

## Timesheet has not been submitted#

Email notifications for timesheet approvals are only triggered when the timesheet is submitted.

To confirm:

- Navigate to the Approvals page from the sidebar
- Check the “Unsubmitted” and “Pending” tabs
- Look for the timesheet in question
- Check with the user whether the Submit button was clicked

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us atsupport@clockify.meand provide us with the following information:

# [ARTICLE] Project or Team Managers can’t see or approve timesheets
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/managers-cant-see-timesheets

In this article

- Approval permissions are not enabled for the manager’s role
- The manager is not assigned to the relevant projects or users
- Timesheets have already been approved by an Admin

If Project or Team Managers don’t have access to timesheets or can’t approve them, the issue typically relates to the workspace settings or how their role is configured. Here’s how to identify what’s preventing access.

## Approval permissions are not enabled for the manager’s role#

Project or Team Managers can only approve timesheets if the workspace is configured to allow it.

To check the workspace approval setup:

- Click on the three dots next to the workspace name
- Select “Workspace settings”
- Navigate to the Permissions tab
- Review the setting under the “Who can approve timesheets and expenses”
- If it’s set to Admins and Project Managers, only Admins and PMs can approve
- If it’s set to Admins and Team Managers, only Admins and TMs can approve

If the wrong approval group is selected, the manager won’t see any approval options even if they’re assigned to projects or teams.

## The manager is not assigned to the relevant projects or users#

- Project Managers will only receive timesheets containing entries for the projects they manage.
- Team Managers will only receive timesheets from users they manage.

To verify management assignments:

- Navigate to the Team page
- Find the manager in question and click on their role title
- Under the Project Manager or Team Manager role, click to open the list of assigned projects or team members
- Make sure the correct projects or users are selected

## Timesheets have already been approved by an Admin#

Admins can approve any timesheet, regardless of project or team. Once a timesheet is approved by an Admin, it cannot be approved again by Project or Team Manager.

In this case, the approval option will no longer be available for Project or Team Managers because the timesheet is already approved. You can find those timesheets under the “Archive” tab on the Approvals page.

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us atsupport@clockify.meand provide us with the following information:

- Information about your assigned role
- A screenshot of the assigned users or projects
- The name of the user whose timesheet should be available for approval


# [ARTICLE] User timesheet discrepancy
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/timesheet-discrepancy-2

In this article

- Time entries are shown in the viewer’s time zone
- Check the exact start and end times in Detailed report
- Duration remains accurate

If time entries in a user’s timesheet appear shifted, longer or shorter than expected, or don’t match what was originally tracked, the issue is most likely caused by time zone differences between the user and the person viewing the timesheet.

Clockify automatically adjusts time entries based on the local timezone of whoever is viewing them.

## Time entries are shown in the viewer’s time zone#

Clockify displays time entries according to the time zone of the person viewing them, not the time zone in which they were tracked.

For example, if a user tracks time from 09:00 to 17:00 in UTC+1, and a manager in UTC-5 views the entry, it may appear as 3:00 to 11:00, even though the duration is still accurate.

## Check the exact start and end times in Detailed report#

If the user is in a different time zone, the times shown will still be adjusted to the viewer’s time zone by default.

To match the user’s time zone:

- Click on your profile icon in the upper right corner
- Select “Preferences”
- Under the time zone, switch to the user’s time zone

This will show the time entry exactly as it was tracked.

To see the original tracked start and end time:

- Go to the Detailed report page
- Locate the time entry in question

## Duration remains accurate#

Even if start and end times appear shifted, the total duration of the time entry is always correct, regardless of time zone.

This applies whether the time was tracked:

- Manually, or
- Using the timer feature

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us atsupport@clockify.meand provide us with the following information:

- A screenshot of the time entries from the Timesheet and Detailed report
- Information on whether you are in the same time zone as the user in question


# [ARTICLE] I can’t submit a timesheet
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/cant-submit-timesheet

In this article

- Device time zone doesn’t match Clockify time zone
- Your timesheet includes entries linked to deleted projects
- Your timesheet is empty
- Your profile time zone differs from the workspace owner’s

If the submit button is missing on your timesheet, here’s what might be causing it.

## Device time zone doesn’t match Clockify time zone#

If your device’s time zone doesn’t match what’s set in Clockify, the system may prevent you from submitting a timesheet.

- Look for a yellow attention sign at the top of the page
- Click on it to resolve the discrepancy
- Make sure your device’s time zone and your Clockify profile time settings match

Here’s how to change the time zone in Clockify:

- Click on your profile picture in the upper right corner of the screen
- Select “Preferences”
- Select the correct time zone from the drop-down under the Time Settings

## Your timesheet includes entries linked to deleted projects#

If a project has been deleted, any time entry linked to it will now appear without a project, which is a required field.

- If that’s the case, you’ll see a warning at the top of the page
- Click Fix, and you’ll be redirected to the Detailed Report
- From there, you can assign a new project (if your workspace permissions allow it)

## Your timesheet is empty#

If you haven’t tracked any time for the week, there’s nothing to submit.

- Add at least one time entry to enable the Submit button

## Your profile time zone differs from the workspace owner’s#

If your profile is in a different time zone than the workspace owner, the submit button won’t appear due to how Clockify handles time zones.

- Go to the “Preferences” settings under your profile picture
- Change your time zone to match the owner’s
- Once aligned, submit the timesheet and revert to your native time zone (optional)

Clockify stores all time entries in the UTC time zone on the server. What you see in the web app is adjusted based on the time zone in your profile settings. This means:

- If your profile is set to a different timezone than the workspace owner, the start and end times of your entries may appear to fall outside the expected range for that timesheet period
- To prevent inaccurate approvals, the system disables the Submit button until everyone is aligned with the same time zone

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us at support@clockify.me and include the following details:

- Your current time zone
- A screenshot of your timesheet view
- A screenshot of any warnings you might have received at the top of the timesheet page


# [ARTICLE] The rate change won’t apply to time entries
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/rate-change-wont-apply

In this article

- A more specific rate is overriding the one you changed
- The rate wasn’t applied to past time entries
- The time entries are approved

If your updated hourly rate isn’t showing up in reports, it’s likely because something else is overriding it or preventing the update. Here’s what to check and how to fix it.

## A more specific rate is overriding the one you changed#

Clockify prioritizes rates in the following order (from lowest to highest priority):

- Workspace rate
- Project rate
- Team rate
- Task rate
- Project member rate

More specific rates will override less specific ones. Even if you change the team rate, for example, the project member rate will take precedence.

What to do:

Check and adjust the specific rate that may be overriding the one you intended to change:

- Workspace rate
- Click on the three dots next to the workspace name
- Select “Workspace settings”
- Scroll a bit down and check the workspace rate
- Project rate
- Navigate to the Projects page from the sidebar
- Find the project from the list and click to open it
- Navigate to the “Settings” tab and check the hourly rate
- Team member rate
- Navigate to the Team tab from the sidebar
- Check the Rate column next to each user
- Task rate
- Navigate to the Projects page from the sidebar
- Click on a project to open it
- Navigate to the Tasks tab
- Check the rate next to each task
- Project member rate
- Navigate to the Projects page
- Click on the project to open it
- Navigate to the Access tab
- Check or change the rate next to each user

## The rate wasn’t applied to past time entries#

Even if you set the right rate, Clockify won’t retroactively apply it to past time entries unless you explicitly choose to do so.

What to do:

- If you’re on a paid plan, go back to the rate settings and check the “Apply to all past and future time entries” option when saving.
- If you’re on a free plan, go to the Detailed report, find the affected time entries, and toggle the billable icon off and on to refresh the rate.

## The time entries are approved#

Approved time entries are locked, including their hourly rate. If a time entry is approved, rate changes won’t apply even if everything else is correct.

What to do:

You’ll need to withdraw the timesheet to unlock it and update it:

- Go to the Approvals tab from the sidebar
- Open the Archive tab
- Locate and click on the timesheet in question to open it
- In the upper right corner, click Withdraw
- Go back to your rate settings and update the rate
- Once the rate is correctly applied, you can resubmit the timesheet for approval

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us at support@clockify.me and include the following details:

# [ARTICLE] Reports and invoices don’t match
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/invoices-dont-match

In this article

- Reports calculate time with more decimals than invoices
- Invoices round each entry before calculating totals
- How to match invoices and reports
- How to enable time rounding

If you’re noticing small differences between the amounts shown in your reports and invoices, it’s not an error. This happens because Clockify calculated them in slightly different ways to keep things precise.

## Reports calculate time with more decimals than invoices#

Clockify tracks time with multiple decimal places, like 1.375 hours, for example.

- Reports show time in full format (unless changed in the Workspace Settings), like 1:15:45 or 1 hour, 15 minutes, and 45 seconds.
- Invoices, on the other hand, convert and round time to two decimal places, like 1.26 hours.

This difference in how time is handled leads to small variations in total.

## Invoices round each entry before calculating totals#

When generating an invoice, Clockify rounds each time entry to 2 decimals before multiplying by the rate. Reports calculate total time first, then multiply.

Example:

You tracked three entries:

- Entry 1: 1:15:45
- Entry 2: 2:45:30
- Entry 3: 0:59:50

Report totals:

- Total time = 5:01:05 (5 hours, 1 minute, 5 seconds)
- At $100/h -> $501.08

Invoice totals:

- Entry 1: 1:15:45 -> 1.26h
- Entry 2: 2:45:30 -> 2.76h
- Entry 3: 0:59:50 -> 1.00h
- Total = 1.26 + 2.76 + 1.00 = 5.02h
- At $100/h -> $502.00

The invoice ends up showing $502.00, while the report shows $501.08, a $0.92 difference due to rounding conversion.

## How to match invoices and reports#

To make both features calculate time in the same way, turn on time rounding for all time entries.

Best option:

- Set rounding to the nearest 6 minutes (which equals 0.1h).

Clockify uses 0.1 hours = 6 minutes as the rounding base, Since both reports and invoices will round each time entry the same way, to the nearest 6-minute block, you get consistent results across the board.

Example:

Let’s say you have this time entry:

- Actual tracked time: 1:07:00 = 1.1166… hours

Without rounding:

- Report uses 1.1166h -> $111.66
- Invoice rounds: 1.12h -> $112.00

$0.34 difference

With rounding to the nearest six minutes:

- 1:07:00 rounds to 1.1h (because 6 minutes = 0.1h)
- Both report and invoice use 1.1h -> $110.00

By rounding to a number divisible by 6, all entries land on the same time unit (e.g., 1.0h, 1.1h, 1.2h…), which removes all seconds that cause mismatches.

## How to enable time rounding#

- Click on the three dots next to the Workpsace name
- Select “Workpsace settings”
- Scroll down and navigate to the Time Rounding section
- Choose “Round up to 6 minutes”

# [ARTICLE] Time entries aren’t importing into invoices
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/time-entries-not-importing

In this article

- The time entries aren’t assigned to a project or a client
- The wrong project is selected when creating an invoice
- The time entries have already been invoiced

If your time entries aren’t showing up when creating an invoice, here’s how to fix it.

## The time entries aren’t assigned to a project or a client#

Invoices in Clockify are based on clients, and time entries must be connected to a project that belongs to a client. If you tracked time without assigning it to a project, or the project isn’t assigned to a client, the time won’t show up when importing invoices.

How to assign time entries to a project using Bulk Edit:

- Navigate to the Detailed report
- Select the relevant date range from the calendar
- Click the checkbox next to “time entry”
- Click “Bulk Edit”
- Check the project option and select the correct project from the drop-down menu
- Click Save

How to assign a project to a client:

- Navigate to the Projects page from the sidebar
- Click on the project to open it
- Navigate to the Settings tab
- Under Client, choose a client from the dropdown or create a new one

## The wrong project is selected when creating an invoice#

Only time entries from the selected projects for the chosen client will be pulled into the invoice.

How to compare invoice selection with the Detailed report:

- Open the Detailed report and filter by the desired time period
- Look at the Project and Client section for the relevant time entries

Or:

- Open the Detailed report and select a date range from the calendar
- Filter a report by using Client and Project filters
- Apply filter
- Go to the invoices and click on “Create new invoice”
- Make sure you’ve selected the same client show  in the report
- In the Projects dropdown, confirm same projects from the report are selected

If the client or project isn’t selected in the invoice, the time won’t be imported.

The date range is incorrect

Clockify defaults to last month when importing time entries into an invoice. If your entries are from this month or a different period, they won’t show.

How to compare the date range with the Detailed report:

- Open the Detailed report and set the date range you want to invoice
- Confirm which days the time entries fall on
- Go to the invoice and click “Import time and expenses”
- Change the date range to match the one you used in the Detailed report

Make sure the date range in the invoice fully covers the dates from the report. Even a one-day gap can cause entries to be excluded.

## The time entries have already been invoiced#

Clockify only allows each time entry to be invoiced once. If the time you’re trying to import has already been used in another invoice, it won’t show up again.

How to check the Detailed report:

- Go to Detailed report
- Select a relevant date range from the calendar
- Click on the Status filter and select “invoiced”
- Apply a filter, and look for the “invoiced” tag next to a time entry

How to see which invoice it was imported to:

- Hover over the invoice tag on an entry, and you’ll see the name of the invoice that entry was added to

# [ARTICLE] Invoice total is $0
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/invoice-total-is-0

In this article

- Non-billable time entries won’t appear on invoices
- The hourly rate is $0
- A more specific $0 rate is overriding your intended rate

If your invoice shows a total of $0, or no time entries at all, it usually means the time entries are missing a billable rate or weren’t marked as billable to begin with. Here’s how to find and fix the issue.

## Non-billable time entries won’t appear on invoices#

Clockify invoices only include billable time entries. If your entries were tracked as non-billable, they won’t be available for import into the invoice at all. The invoice will appear empty.

How to check:

- Navigate to the Detailed report and select the relevant date range
- Look for the billable icon (dollar sign) next to your entries
- If the icon is grayed out, the entry is not billable

To fix it:

- Select the entries by clicking the checkbox next to “time entry’
- Select Bulk Edit
- Check the billable checkbox and toggle the button
- Save changes

After marking the entries as billable, return to the invoice and try importing again.

## The hourly rate is $0#

If your entries are billable but still not showing a total, the applied hourly rate is likely set to $0. Clockify will treat that as valid time with no cost.

Where to check:

- Project rate
- Navigate to the Projects page from the sidebar
- Find the project from the list and click to open it
- Navigate to the “Settings” tab and check the hourly rate
- Workspace rate
- Click on the three dots next to the workspace name
- Select “Workspace settings”
- Scroll a bit down and check the workspace rate
- Team member rate
- Navigate to the Team tab from the sidebar
- Check the Rate column next to each user
- Task rate
- Navigate to the Projects page from the sidebar
- Click on a project to open it
- Navigate to the Tasks tab
- Check the rate next to each task
- Project member rate
- Navigate to the Projects page
- Click on the project to open it
- Navigate to the Access tab
- Check or change the rate next to each user

## A more specific $0 rate is overriding your intended rate#

Clockify follows a rate hierarchy, where more specific rates override more general ones. So even if you’ve set a project or workspace rate, a blank $0 project member or a task rate can silently override it, resulting in an empty invoice or a $0 total.

Rate hierarchy from lowest to highest:

- Workspace rate
- Project rate
- Team rate
- Task rate
- Project member rate

What to do:

Start by checking for any blank or 0$ rates at the top of the hierarchy (Task or Project Member), and work your way down. These will override the more general rates and lead to a $- invoice total.

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us at support@clockify.me and include the following details:

- A screenshot of the invoice in question
- A screenshot of the Detailed report showing billable time
- Confirmation on which rates were set and where


# [ARTICLE] I can’t select a project when creating an invoice
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/cant-select-project

In this article

- The wrong client is selected in the invoice
- The project is archived and filtered out of view
- The project isn’t assigned to a client

If you’re creating an invoice but can’t find or select the project you need, here’s how to fix it.

## The wrong client is selected in the invoice#

Only projects tied to the specific client you selected when creating an invoice will appear in the project dropdown.

Even if the project is correctly assigned to a client, it won’t show up unless it’s tied to the exact client currently selected on the invoice.

What to do:

- On the New Invoice screen, check the Client dropdown at the top
- Confirm that this is the same client assigned to the project you’re trying to select
- If the client doesn’t match, the project won’t appear in the list
- If needed, edit the project to assign it to the correct client:
- Go to the Projects page
- Click on the project to open it
- Navigate to the Settings tab and change the client

## The project is archived and filtered out of view#

Archived projects can be selected when creating an invoice, but they are hidden by default. The invoice project dropdown only shows active projects unless you manually change the filter.

How to make archived projects visible:

- On the “Import time and expenses” Screen, click the Projects dropdown
- In the top right corner of the dropdown, click the small arrow next to “Show”
- Select Active and Archived to display all projects
- Once selected, your archived project should now appear and be available for invoicing

## The project isn’t assigned to a client#

Invoices are client-based, so only projects tied to the selected client will appear in the project dropdown.

How to assign a project to a client:

- Go to the Projects page
- Click on the project to open it
- Navigate to the Settings tab
- Assign the correct client

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us at support@clockify.me and include the following details:

# [ARTICLE] I can’t select a project or a task when tracking time
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/cant-select-project-2

In this article

- The task field is required, but no task is available
- The task is marked as done
- The user doesn’t have access to the project

If you’re trying to select a task or a project when tracking time and it’s missing or blocked, here’s how to troubleshoot it.

## The task field is required, but no task is available#

If your workspace requires a task for every time entry, and no task is available to select, you won’t be able to start the timer or save a manual time entry.

How to check (as an Admin):

- Click on the three dots next to the Workspace name
- Select “Workspace settings”
- Scroll a bit down and check the “Do not allow saving time without” section
- If the task is marked as required, make sure that the relevant project has at least one active task

## The task is marked as done#

When a task is marked as done, it’s removed from the picker, and it can’t be tracked against unless reactivated.

How to reactivate a done task (Admin or Project Manager):

- Go to the Projects page
- Click on the project to open it
- Navigate to the Tasks tab
- Look for tasks that appear crossed out with a line
- Click on the three dots next to the task
- Select “Mark as active”

Once reactivated, the task will reappear in the project picker.

## The user doesn’t have access to the project#

If the project is set to private and the user hasn’t been added to it, they won’t see the project or any of its tasks.

How to check and fix (as an Admin or Project Manager):

- Navigate to the Projects page
- Click on the project to open it
- Click on the “Access” tab
- Make sure the user is listed under “Members”

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us at support@clockify.me and include the following details:

- A screenshot of the project picker from the Time Tracker page
- Information about your role in the workspace
- A screenshot of the project or task in question from the Projects page, if available


# [ARTICLE] Project status and reports don’t match
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/project-status-match

In this article

- Project status shows all-time totals
- Time rounding doesn’t apply to project status
- Invoiced time is not deducted from the project status
- Project status is always displayed in decimal format

If you’re seeing different numbers between the Project status page and the Detailed or Summary reports, here’s a breakdown of why the values may not match and how to interpret them correctly.

## Project status shows all-time totals#

The Project status page always shows data from the start of the project to the current date. It does not respond to any date range filters.

What this means:

- If you run a report for last month, but the project started earlier, you’ll see a lower total in the report.
- The project status will show the full total from day one of the project.

How to match them more closely:

- Extend the report date range to cover the full project duration if you want to compare values.

## Time rounding doesn’t apply to project status#

Time rounding rules set in Workspace settings only affect reports and exports, not the project status page.

What this means:

- If you’ve rounded time entries (e.g., to the nearest 6 minutes), reports will reflect that rounded value
- The project status page will use actual tracked time (unrounded), resulting in small differences

How to check:

- Open the Detailed report and turn off the rounding
- You’ll likely see values that more closely match the project status

## Invoiced time is not deducted from the project status#

Invoicing a time entry does not remove or subtract it from the project’s tracked time or progress.

What this means:

- If you’ve already invoiced 20 hours, you might expect those to be removed from the project
- They’ll still be counted in full as project status tracks total effort, not outstanding or un-invoiced time

## Project status is always displayed in decimal format#

Regardless of how your workspace is configured (e.g., full, compact, or decimal format), the Project status page will always show time in decimal format.

What this means:

- If your report says 1h 30m, the Project status page will display that as 1.5h
- This is just a difference in formatting, not an error or miscalculation

Use the Detailed report in the decimal format if you want a side-by-side comparison that matches the project status format.

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us at support@clockify.me and include the following details:

- A screenshot of the Project status page for the project in question
- A screenshot of the report you’re comparing it to


# [ARTICLE] Not receiving project estimate alerts
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/not-receiving-alerts

In this article

- Alerts are not sent immediately
- Alerts are only sent once per threshold
- Workspace alert rules may be misconfigured
- Your role doesn’t match the alert rule
- Your personal email preferences may be disabled

If you’ve set up a time or budget estimate on a project or a task but aren’t receiving alerts when the threshold is crossed, here’s how to troubleshoot the issue and ensure alerts are properly delivered.

## Alerts are not sent immediately#

Estimate alerts are sent approximately 30 minutes after the threshold is reached, meaning that if your estimate is set to trigger at 80%, an alert won’t appear instantly. It will typically be delivered via email within 30-40 minutes.

## Alerts are only sent once per threshold#

Clockify sends a single alert when the estimate threshold is reached, for example, 80% or 100%. If your tracked time jumps rapidly past multiple thresholds, you’ll only receive the alert for the highest one reached, not for the lower thresholds passed.

## Workspace alert rules may be misconfigured#

Admins define who receives alerts and when they are sent. If no alert rules exist or the wrong group is selected, notifications won’t go out.

How to check (Admins):

- Click on the three dots next to the Workspace name
- Select “Workspace settings”
- Navigate to the Alerts tab
- Review the rules and confirm which group is selected:
- Admins
- Project Managers
- Project Members

You can define multiple rules that include all groups by clicking on the “Add” button.

## Your role doesn’t match the alert rule#

Even if you are a part of the workspace, you won’t receive alerts unless your role matches the selected rule.

Examples:

- If the rule says Project managers, you must be assigned as a project manager on that project.
- If the rule says Project members, you must be added to the project access list.

How to verify:

- For Project Managers:
- Navigate to the Projects page from the sidebar
- Check the list of projects for that specific project

Clockify only shows you the projects you are officially assigned to manage.

- For regular users (verified by Admins or Project Managers)
- Navigate to the Projects page from the sidebar
- Click on the project to open it
- Go to the Access tab
- Check if the team member in question is listed under the “Members” section

## Your personal email preferences may be disabled#

Even if the alert rules are correct, you won’t receive alerts if you’ve disabled them in your email preferences.

- Click on your profile picture located in the upper-right corner and select “Preferences”
- Navigate to the “Email Preferences” tab
- Make sure “Alerts” option is selected

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us at support@clockify.me and include the following details:

# [ARTICLE] Understanding Project Estimates, Budgets, and Alerts
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/understanding-project-estimates

In this article

- Estimate progress bars can exceed 100%
- Recurring budgets reset automatically
- Alerts may not trigger if not configured at that threshold
- Alerts are not retroactive
- Clockify doesn’t block tracking beyond estimates
- Time estimate vs. Budget estimate
- Task-level estimates also support alerts
- Estimate alerts are only sent once per threshold

Clockify gives you multiple ways to track progress and stay informed through time estimates, budget estimates, and alerts. These features work in specific ways, and here’s a complete breakdown.

## Estimate progress bars can exceed 100%#

When your tracked time or budget goes beyond the estimate, Clockify does not stop tracking. Instead, the project progress bar will go past 100% to reflect overage.

- 125% = 25% over the estimate
- This behavior is intentional and helps you measure how much you’ve exceeded

## Recurring budgets reset automatically#

If you’ve set a weekly, monthly, or yearly recurring estimate, the budget will reset automatically at the end of each cycle based on the project’s start date.

What this means:

- Budgets don’t disappear; they just start fresh for the new period
- Project status only shows progress for the current cycle

How to preserve historical data

Before the reset date:

- Go to the Projects page
- Click Export (CSV or Excel)
- The export includes tracked time, budget, estimate, overage, progress, and more

This serves as a backup or a reference if you want to compare performance across periods.

## Alerts may not trigger if not configured at that threshold#

Estimate alerts are only sent for thresholds that are explicitly defined.

Example:

If you set an alert only at 80% and not at 100%, you won’t receive anything when the estimate is fully reached.

What to do:

Set alerts at all relevant thresholds (e.g., 50%, 80%, 100%) under workspace settings -> Alerts.

## Alerts are not retroactive#

If you create or edit an alert rule after a threshold is already passed, Clockify will not trigger the alert retroactively.

## Clockify doesn’t block tracking beyond estimates#

Estimates are for informational purposes only. Clockify will not automatically prevent time tracking on those projects once an estimate or a budget is used up.

What you can do instead:

- Set up alerts to notify when the estimate is near or exceeded
- Use the Project status page to view the current status
- Create clear internal guidelines for stopping work manually

Optional control method:

Once the project reaches its estimate or a budget limit, an Admin or a Project Manager can:

- Go to the Projects page
- Click on the project
- Select Archive

This will prevent team members from tracking additional time on that project, effectively enforcing a soft stop.

## Time estimate vs. Budget estimate#

Clockify allows you to track a project’s progress using two types of estimates: time estimates and budget estimates.

- A time estimate refers to the number of hours you expect to spend on a project. It’s based purely on tracked time entries and is ideal when you’re managing internal workload, capacity, or effort.
- A budget estimate, on the other hand, refers to the monetary value you expect to bill for a project. It depends on having hourly rates set up, either at the project or task level.

## Task-level estimates also support alerts#

You can assign estimates and alerts to tasks, not just full projects.

You can notify:

- Task assignees
- Project Manager
- Workspace admin

Only one role can be selected per alert rule, but you can create multiple rules to notify several roles.

## Estimate alerts are only sent once per threshold#

You’ll receive one alert per threshold (e.g., 80%, 100%). If the progress jumps over multiple thresholds at once (e.g., from 75% to 95%), only the highest one will trigger.

An alert for a threshold will only trigger again if the project drops below that value and then crosses it again.

In this article

- How to change client currency
- How to add currencies to the workspace

If you’re trying to change the currency for a client but don’t see any options in the dropdown, it’s likely because no additional currencies have been added yet.

## How to change client currency#

- Navigate to the Clients page from the sidebar
- Click on the pen icon next to the Client you want to edit
- In the pop-up window, scroll down to the button and click on the Currency dropdown
- Select the desired currency and save changes

If the dropdown is empty, it means no other currencies have been created yet.

## How to add currencies to the workspace#

To assign different currencies to clients, you’ll need to first create those currencies in your Workspace Settings. Only then will they appear as options when editing a client.

To add new currencies to your workspace:

- Click on the three dots next to the Workspace name at the top of the page
- Select “Workspace settings”
- Scroll a bit down and click on “Edit” under the Currencies section
- Select “Add currency”
- Enter the currency abbreviation (e.g., EUR, GBP, CAD) and save

After that, go back to the Clients page and edit the client again. The new currency options will now be available in the dropdown.

Once the client’s currency is updated, all projects assigned to that client will automatically apply the selected currency for budgeting and invoicing.

In this article

- The wrong calendar might be connected

# [ARTICLE] Time entries aren’t syncing to QuickBooks
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/entries-not-syncing-to-quickbooks

In this article

- QuickBooks plan may not be supported
- Client and project mapping don’t match
- Check for new users and customers
- Reconnect the integration
- Only billable time entries will sync

If time entries aren’t syncing to QuickBooks, it could be due to how the integration is set up, plan compatibility, or how projects and clients are structured. Here’s how the connection works and what to check if syncing fails.

## QuickBooks plan may not be supported#

Clockify QuickBooks integration works only with:

- QuickBooks Online Essentials
- QuickBooks Online Plus

If you’re using QBO Simple Start, Advanced with Payroll, or any plan with Payroll enabled, the integration will not work due to compatibility issues.

To check your plan:

- Open QuickBooks Online
- Go to Account and Settings -> Billing and Subscription
- Review your current plan and features

## Client and project mapping don’t match#

Mapping between Clockify and QuickBooks happens based on matching names and structure.

- The user name from Clockify must match an Employee name in QuickBooks
- If using only projects in Clockify, project names must be identical to Customer names in QBO
- If using both clients and projects in Clockify:Clockify clients must have the same name as the parent customers in QBOClockfy projects must have the same name as sub-customers in QBO
- Clockify clients must have the same name as the parent customers in QBO
- Clockfy projects must have the same name as sub-customers in QBO

If you only have projects in Clockify, in that case, you would sync them with customers in QuickBooks; however, if projects also have clients in Clockify, then your project will actually be a sub-customer and the client a parent customer in QBO.

## Check for new users and customers#

If everything has been set following the data mapping rules, make sure to resync your QBO data with Clockify.

- Click on the three dots next to your Workspace name
- Select “Workspace settings.”
- Click on the Integrations tab
- Click on the “Check for new users and customers” button

## Reconnect the integration#

If data sync was unsuccessful, try disconnecting the integration.

- Navigate to the Workspace settings by clicking on the three dots next to the Workspace name
- Open the Integrations tab
- Select the dropdown arrow next to QuickBooks
- Click Disconnect
- Reconnect your QuickBooks account and follow the prompts

## Only billable time entries will sync#

Make sure your time entries meet these criteria:

- Marked as billable (represented by blue dollar icon in Clockify)
- Assigned to a project (and client, if applicable)
- Tracked by a mapped user

You can check all of this via the Detailed report in Clockify.

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us at support@clockify.me and include the following details:

- Information about your current QBO plan and whether you have a Payroll feature enabled
- A screenshot of any error messages you might have received when sending time to QBO

In this article

- Free plan allows only one active kiosk
- Kiosk is already running
- Deactivate and reactivate the kiosk
- Clear browser memory or use incognito mode

This message usually means the system thinks there is an active session somewhere. Here’s how to fix it.

## Free plan allows only one active kiosk#

If you are on the free plan, you can only have one kiosk active at a time. Trying to launch a second one will trigger this message.

What to do:

- Check if you already have an active kiosk running on another device or a browser tab
- If needed, close that kiosk before launching a new one

Multiple kiosks are available only on our paid plans.

## Kiosk is already running#

Make sure the kiosk isn’t already open and active on another device. Ask your team or check the device it was last used on.

## Deactivate and reactivate the kiosk#

If no one else is using the kiosk, try resetting it:

- Go to the Kiosks page from the sidebar
- Click on the three dots next to the kiosk and select Deactivate
- Once inactive, click on the three dots again and select Activate
- Copy the link and try launching it again

## Clear browser memory or use incognito mode#

# [ARTICLE] Common errors and issues
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/common-errors-and-issues

In this article

- Start time is greater than end time
- 403 - Forbidden
- 401 - Unauthorized
- 400 - Required token or API key and 1000 - Full authentication required

## Start time is greater than end time#

This error occurs when the start time in your API request is after the end time, often due to a mismatch between local time zones and UTC, which is what the Clockify API expects.

Why this happens:

- The Clockify API uses UTC time for all time-based values
- Sending a start time in local time (e.g., Brussels +1) without converting it to UTC may result in a start time that appears later than the end time.

How to fix it:

- Make sure both start and end times in your request are converted to UTC.
- Double-check the full API request:Endpoint usedRequest body and time fieldsHeaders (especially Content-Type and authentication)Time zone settings on the server or script generating the request
- Endpoint used
- Request body and time fields
- Headers (especially Content-Type and authentication)
- Time zone settings on the server or script generating the request

Even if a non-UTC start time is accepted, the timer might begin with a negative duration, which can affect calculations and reporting. Converting to UTC resolves this issue completely.

## 403 – Forbidden#

This error means your request is understood by the server, but you’re not authorized to perform the action due to missing permissions or feature restrictions.

Why this happens:

- The API key being used doesn’t have permission for the requested operation
- The user’s role (e.g., Project Manager or a Team Manager) has limited access
- The subscription plan doesn’t include the requested feature
- You’re requesting a report with amounts, but you don’t have permission to view amounts

How to fix it:

- Check user role and permissions:

Make sure the API key belongs to a user with the correct role and access to the resource.

- Verify subscription:

Some endpoints and features require a paid plan, like “Add time for others”, for example.

- Regenerate your API key:
- Click on your Profile picture and select Preferences
- Open the Advanced tab
- Click Generate next to the API key field
- If generating a report as a Project or a Team Manager:

If amounts are restricted and you don’t have access, use the following parameter in your request:

“amountShown”: “HIDE_AMOUNT”

This will generate the report without including financial data.

## 401 – Unauthorized#

This error means authentication failed, usually because the API key is missing, invalid, or not authorized to access the requested source.

Why this happens:

- API key is missing, invalid, or incorrectly passed in the header
- API key is associated with a user who doesn’t have access to the endpoint
- The current subscription plan doesn’t support the requested feature

How to fix it:

- Verify that the API key is included correctly

X-Api-Key: your_api_key

- Check that the API key is valid:
- Click on your profile picture and select Preferences
- Open the Advanced tab
- Click Generate to create a new API key
- Ensure correct permissions

The user tied to the API key must have access to the requested workspace, project, or feature.

- Double-check your plan:

Some API endpoints are only available on paid plans, like “Add time for others”, for example.

## 400 – Required token or API key and 1000 – Full authentication required#

This error appears when the request is missing an authentication header, meaning the system doesn’t know who is making the request.

Why this happens:

- The API call is missing the X-Api-Key in the headers
- The request might be sent from a script or tool that didn’t properly include authentication info

How to fix it:

Include the following header in your request:

X-Api-Key: your_api_key

Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further. Please contact us at support@clockify.me and include the following details:

- A screenshot of the request and response you’re getting
- Information about your role in the workspace
- A screenshot of the error message you see in the response

# [ARTICLE] How Clockify handles your data
https://clockify.me/help/troubleshooting/how-clockify-handles-your-data

In this article

- Is my data safe in Clockify?
- What data does Clockify collect?
- Export your data for personal backup

Clockify takes data security seriously and gives users full control over how their data is stored, accessed, and exported. Here’s how data is handled and how you can create your own backups when needed.

## Is my data safe in Clockify?#

Clockify data is securely hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and protected both physically and electronically. All connections between you and Clockify are encrypted using 256-bit SSL encryption, the same standard used in online banking.

While we perform regular infrastructure-level backups, Clockify does not offer per-account recovery in cases where data is accidentally deleted or overwritten by users. For this reason, it’s highly recommended to create personal backups of your data on a regular basis.

You can read more about security measures here.

## What data does Clockify collect?#

Clockify only stores data you actively provide or consent to:

- Cookies are used for login sessions
- Google Analytics tracks which website pages are visited (anonymized)
- Manual input is required for time tracking. Clockify does not log data automatically unless you enable it
- Idle detection and auto-tracker are optional features; data from these remains private and is only visible to the user
- Screenshots and location tracking are only collected if explicitly enabled by an admin. All users are notified when these features are activated
- Location tracking applies to the mobile app (if permissions are granted)
- Screenshots are collected via the desktop app (if installed and running)

At any time, you can delete your account and all associated data. For more details, refer to our Privacy Policy.

## Export your data for personal backup#

You can export all your time-tracking data at any time using the Detailed Report:

- Go to the reports page and select Detailed report
- Set the longest possible date range from the calendar
- Export to CSV

This export contains all relevant time entry data and can serve as a personal archive or recovery point.

Creating periodic exports gives you full control of your records and acts as a safeguard against accidental deletions or workspace resets.

In this article

- Troubleshooting SAML 2.0 Issues
- Troubleshooting OAuth2 Issues (e.g., Google, Microsoft)
- Best Practices for Admins
- Need More Help?

If you or your team encounter issues while logging into Clockify using SSO (via SAML 2.0 or OAuth2), use this guide to quickly identify and resolve the most common problems.

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
| You don’t have permission to access this workspace | User not added to the Clockify workspace | Manually invite the user, check if the user is assigned to the Clockify app on IdP, or enable auto-provisioning |
| SAML Authentication Failed / Invalid response | Misconfigured SAML metadata or missing email claim | Check Entity ID, SSO URL, and ensure email attribute is present |
| No email received in SAML response | Email claim not configured in IdP | Add claim named email mapped to user.mail or user.userprincipalname |
| OAuth2 login redirects but fails silently | Missing scopes or misconfigured redirect URI | Verify client settings in the OAuth2 provider and ensure the redirect URI is correct |
| The user exists but can’t log in via SSO | The user belongs to a different workspace | Verify the user is added to the correct Clockify workspace |
| Expired certificate or token | IdP certificate/token not renewed | Rotate certificate or regenerate tokens as needed |

Owner can always log in using the original credentials athttps://mysubdomain.clockify.me/login-owner.

## Troubleshooting SAML 2.0 Issues#

### “You don’t have permission to access this workspace”

Clockify can’t authenticate the user because they haven’t been added to the workspace.

Fix:

- Invite the user manually fromTeam → Invite
- Or enableAuto-provisioningunderSSO settings

### Incorrect or Incomplete SAML Setup

Verify the following in both Clockify and your IdP:

- Entity ID,SAML SSO URL,Metadata URL,Relay StateandX.509 Certificateare correct
- Theemailattribute is included in the SAML assertion
- Clockify workspace domain matches what’s configured in IdP
- NameID Formatis set to emailAddress

### Missing Email Claim

Fix (Azure AD example):

- Go toEnterprise applications → your app → Single sign-on
- UnderAttributes & Claims, add a claim:Name: emailSource attribute: user.mail
- Name: email
- Source attribute: user.mail

### User Belongs to a Different Workspace

Fix:

- Confirm the user is invited to the correct workspace
- Workspace SSO settings only apply to that specific workspace

### “SAML Authentication Failed” or “Invalid Response”

- Check if the signature is valid
- NameID is set to email
- Response is within valid time range (NotBefore, NotOnOrAfter)

## Troubleshooting OAuth2 Issues (e.g., Google, Microsoft)#

### User can’t log in via Oauth2

- Check that the email used with OAuth2 matches the one in Clockify

### Redirect URI Mismatch

If you’re using a custom OAuth2 app (e.g., for enterprise Microsoft login), the redirect URI might not be correctly set.

Fix:

- Go to your OAuth2 provider’s app settings
- Make sure to add relevant redirect URI is:

https://app.clockify.me/login/android/oauth2For Android

https://clockify.me/login/ios/oauth2For iOS app

### Invalid Token / Expired Session

Tokens issued by the provider may expire or become invalid.

Fix:

- Try logging out and back in again
- If using Microsoft, ensure consent has been granted for required scopes (like openid, email, profile)

## Best Practices for Admins#

- Regularly check forcertificate expiration
- Always match users by email address across all platforms

## Need More Help?#

If you’re still having trouble, reach out toClockify Supportwith:

# [ARTICLE] Invoice taxes
https://clockify.me/help/projects/taxes-in-invoices

Taxfields in an invoice form shows the amount of tax added to the total price of a product or a service. Tax can either be a general amount added to the total, or broken down by the item, depending on the tax system used. Clockify uses item-based tax system.

### Item-based taxes#

Item-based taxes are used to apply taxes individually to each item on an invoice. This way you can have a better control over your taxes, making sure that taxes are applied only to relevant items.

This feature is available to users onStandardand higher subscription plans and onFree trial.

In order to use it, the Invoicing feature needs to be enabled in theWorkspace settings:

- Navigate to the workspace name at the top left corner of the page
- Open the three-dot menu and chooseWorkspace settings
- Navigate to theInvoicingsection in theGeneralsettings and toggle the switch to enable it

User permissions for this feature depend on the settings in the Permissions tab, in the Workspace settings.

#### How item-based taxes work#

When you create a new invoice, you will see two columns after theAMOUNTcolumn:

- TAX(if only one tax is enabled)
- TAX 2(if a second tax is enabled in the settings)

Each item on the invoice has checkboxes next to theTAXandTAX 2columns. By default, these checkboxes are checked (blue with a white tick), indicating that the taxes are applied. Unchecking them means that taxes willnotbe applied to that particular item.

Taxes are calculated in the following way:

- TAX: This is calculated based on the percentage defined in theInvoice Settings
- TAX 2: If enabled, this is also calculated as a percentage of the item amount

#### Taxation mode#

Taxation mode can be:

- Simple: Both taxes are applied to the total amount of the itemE.g.: For an item priced at $100, withTax 1at 10% andTax 2at 10%, the calculated taxes will be $10 for each, making the total $120.
- E.g.: For an item priced at $100, withTax 1at 10% andTax 2at 10%, the calculated taxes will be $10 for each, making the total $120.
- Compound: The second tax is applied on the taxed amount, not the item amount.E.g.: For an item priced at $100, withTax 1at 10% andTax 2at 10%,Tax 1is $10, andTax 2is calculated on the taxed amount, resulting in $11 forTax 2, making the total $121.
- E.g.: For an item priced at $100, withTax 1at 10% andTax 2at 10%,Tax 1is $10, andTax 2is calculated on the taxed amount, resulting in $11 forTax 2, making the total $121.

ThecheckboxesforTAXandTAX 2are remembered for each item on the invoice, meaning that the selected state is retained until the invoice is manually edited or changes are made to the tax settings. If you change the tax percentage during invoice creation, the totals will update automatically to reflect the new tax rates.If you switch fromSimpletoCompoundor vice versa, allUnsent invoiceswill automatically update to match the new taxation settings.

For example:

- Simple to Compound mode: TheApply taxcheckbox will appear next to each item
- Compound to simple mode: TheTaxandTax 2checkboxes will reappear

If you remove one of the taxes from an invoice, then selected taxation mode will also be removed.If you add a previously removed tax, the system will remember the last selected taxation mode for that invoice.

#### Set taxation mode on individual invoices#

If you’re using two taxes (TAXandTAX 2) you can set a default taxation mode in theInvoice settingsthat will be applied to all new invoices. However, you can override these default settings for individual invoices when creating or editing.

To do that:

- Open the invoice you’re working on
- Scroll down to theTaxation modesection
- Choose whetherSimpleorCompoundtaxation mode should be applied to that specific invoice

Taxation mode for a new invoice will not affect any invoices that are alreadyPartially paid,PaidorVoid.


# [ARTICLE] Time off balance
https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/time-off-balance

In this article

- Set policy expiration
- Allow negative balance
- Manage individual user balance
- Bulk add balances
- Important to remember

Clockify allows you to define when and how time off balances can be used by your team members giving you flexibility and control over your employees’ leave balance.

## Set policy expiration#

You can define if the balance for a specific time off policy expires or never expires. This setting affects all users under that policy.

- Go toTime offpage and openManage policiesinSettings
- ClickEditnext to the policy you want to change
- Go to theBalance expirysection and choose one of two options:Never expires(default)Has expiry dates
- Never expires(default)
- Has expiry dates

The balance thatNever expiresdoesn’t have an expiry date and start/end date.If you chooseHas expiry dates, all future accruals and balances for this policy require a defined start and end date.

When changing policies you switch fromHas expiry datestoNever expires, all existing dates will be removed.If you switch toHas expiry dates, all existing balances will automatically be given a start date of today and future balance additions will require defined dates.

## Allow negative balance#

If you allow negative balance, all workspace members will be able to request time off even if they don’t have enough available hours/days (e.g. for Sick leave).

To allow negative balance:

- Go toTime offpage and openManage policiesinSettings
- ClickEditnext to the policy you want to change
- CheckAllow negative balanceoption
- Limit the number of daysthat user can request within a specific period
- Choose toReset negative balanceat the end of the year to automatically clear all negative time off and return balances to0at the end of the year

By resetting negative balance, you’ll clear all negative days without affecting any time off days that the employee has earned.

## Manage individual user balance#

Owners and admins can apply a specific validity period (start and end date) to any user’s balance. This way users request time off during a specific timeframe. Once that period ends, the balance will expire and be automatically removed.

To add/edit user’s balance:

- Go to theTime offpage and open theBalancetab
- Choose policy and selectUserfrom the dropdown to display team members
- ClickManage balance(orAddnext to the user’s name)
- In the popup, enter the number of days,define the timeline(start and end dates) and add any optional notes
- ClickAddto save changes

In theBalancetab, owners and admins can see all balance components in one place, including any remaining separate negative balance.

## Bulk add balances#

You can add balances to multiple users on a single policy at once:

- On theBalancetab, check the box next to each team member you want to edit
- ClickAdd to balance
- Enter number of days and timeframe and clickAddto complete the process

## Important to remember#

When a user requests time off, Clockify always deducts days from the balance that is expiring the soonest. You can view a user’s balance history by selectingHistorynext to their name.You’ll receive an email with validity period details when your balance is updated.

- Connect Clockify and Xero
- Send invoice from Clockify to Xero
- Payment & status sync
- Create client

Connect Xero to Clockify to create a billing cycle. Send Clockify invoices to Xero and automatically receive payment status updates in Clockify.

This action can be performed by workspace owner/admin.

To use this add-on, you need to find it in theCAKE.com Marketplaceand install it onto your workspace.

## Connect Clockify and Xero#

After you’ve installed the add-on, proceed with connecting the two applications (Xero and Clockify).

To connect Xero to Clockify:

- Go to theWorkspace settingsand open theAdd-onstab
- FindXeroadd-on and openSettings
- ClickConnect Xero
- Allow Xero to access your data and log in to your Xero account
- Now chooseXero tenant(organization) you want to connect to your Clockify workspaces (Xero tenant = Clockify workspace)

After you connected the two apps, you need to go to the add-on settings where you have the following options:

- Send invoice from Clockify to Xero
- Automatically sync invoice payments from Xero to Clockify

## Send invoice from Clockify to Xero#

To successfully send an invoice from Clockify, Xero invoice needs to be in a draft status.

Enable this option to allow theSend to Xeroaction to appear on yourInvoicespage.

To send an invoice from Clockify to Xero:

- Go to the Invoices page in Clockify
- To send an individual invoice, click on the three-dots menu next to the invoice
- ChooseSend to Xero

To send the invoices in bulk, choose theSend to Xerooption from theAdd-on actionsdropdown at the top right corner.

When you send an invoice, the status in Clockify will automatically be updated tosent.When you edit an invoice in Clockify, you can send the updated version to Xero.

## Payment & status sync#

Sync payment and statuses from Xeroto keep your records updated.

Any payment amount received in Xero will be automatically synced and displayed in Clockify.The invoice status in Clockify will change immediately (e.g. topaidorpartially paid) to be in sync with the Xero status.

Taxes in Xero are calculated differently than in Clockify which might lead to a difference in the totals when taxes are turned on.

### Taxes in Xero#

The main reason for the difference in calculation is due torounding on each line item in Xero.

| Calculation method | Xero | Clockify |
| Rounding point | Rounds tax oneach individual line itembefore sum up. | Rounds tax based on theinvoice total. |

To minimize the discrepancy, you can do the following:

- With Xero API, developers can specify and override Xero’s default calculation with their own TaxAmount field when creating an invoice
- Add a rounding adjustment line item to the invoice in Xero to match the Clockify’s total

## Create client#

When you send an invoice to Xero, the client info needs to match.

If the client does not already exist in Xero (as a Contact), a new client record with the same name is created automatically. Also, if the client with the same name exists in Xero, then the invoice is created under the same contact.

Clients/contacts are not case sensitive in Xero, which means that ClockifyCliEntwill map with Xerocontact.

Here are specific examples:

| Scenario | Clockify client | Xero contact | Integration |
| Successful mapping | QuickBuild Solutions | A contact namedQuickBuild Solutionsalready exists. | Invoice is successfully created under the existing Xero contact. |
| Automatically created | Sunshine Cafe | No contact namedSunshine Cafeexists. | Xero automatically creates a new contact namedSunshine Cafeand links the invoice to it. |
| Case-insensitive match | ACME Corp | A contact namedAcme Corpalready exists in Xero. | The system ignores capitalization and links the invoice to the existingAcme Corpcontact. |


# [ARTICLE] Track time in Plaky with Clockify
https://clockify.me/help/integrations/track-time-with-clockify-in-plaky

In this article

- How it works
- Connect Clockify project with Plaky board
- Track time from an item
- Use Plaky to manage your projects

With the Clockify & Plaky integration, you can track time for yourPlakyboards, items, and subitems, and have that time logged as Clockify projects and tasks without switching between the apps.

If you have at least one active workspace in both apps within the same CAKE.com organization, this integration is automatically enabled.

## How it works#

With the Clockify-Plaky integration, you can track time for your projects and tasks directly from Plaky’s boards, items, and subitems. By connecting a Plaky board with a Clockify project, you create a direct link between your Plaky items/subitems and Clockify tasks.

## Connect Clockify project with Plaky board#

To track time on your Plaky items and subitems, you, as a board owner, must have access to at least one Clockify workspace in the sameCAKE.comorganization and connect it to your Plaky board.

To do so:

- Go to yourPlaky board settingsand click onTime tracking
- In the settings, you’ll see a list of Clockify projects you have access to
- Choose the one you want to connect to your board

One Plaky board can only be connected to one Clockify project.

Once you connect the Plaky board to the Clockify project, there is a direct link between your Plaky items/subitems and Clockify tasks and the entire time tracked on this board will be logged under the connected Clockify project.

After connecting your board, you can also choose to lock it for other board members. This prevents them from editing the selected board.

If you don’t have access to Clockify workspace in yourCAKE.comorganization, you can create one directly from the Plaky integration settings.

## Track time from an item#

Once the Plaky board is connected to the Clockify project, a board owner can configure the integration settings directly from the item sidebar, in aTime trackingtab.

Users with access to the connected Clockify project will see aTime trackingtab with predefined settings, including Clockify project, task, and billability.Users without access will be notified that time tracking is not possible and should reach out to an admin.

### Track time via Time tracker#

When you click theStart timerin Plaky, a timer also starts in Clockify. Any changes you make (e.g. update description or task) will automatically sync between both apps.

To use Time tracker:

- Go to your board and open an item/subitem
- ChooseTime tracker>Timertab
- Enter project, task and other necessary details
- ClickStart timerto start tracking time
- Stop timerwhen you’re done

### Track time in Manual mode#

Manual mode lets you enter start and end time for your time entry.

To add time manually:

- Go to your board and open an item/subitem
- ChooseTime tracker>ManualtabYou’ll see a form with predefined details, which you can adjust as needed.
- Enter date, start time, end time, project, task and other necessary details
- ClickAdd timeto complete the action

To add and edit time manually, the Force timer option needs to be disabled in the Workspace settings.

## Use Plaky to manage your projects#

Plaky is a free project management tool that helps you with your projects, teams, and tasks.

# [ARTICLE] Time Off feature update: What changed and what you need to check
https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/time-off-feature-update-what-changed-and-what-you-need-to-check

In this article

- What was improved
- What you need to do
- What looks different
- Exports

In September 2025, we introduced updates to ourTime Offfeature. Since then, we have been listening closely to your feedback regarding balance visibility and policy flexibility.

To ensure your team has the most intuitive experience possible, we have released a series of improvements listed in this article.

This article explains:

- What was improved
- How Time Off balance works now
- What you need to review in your existing policies
- Examples and guides to help you understand the new balance view

## What was improved#

To address reported issues, we’ve made several updates to improve clarity:

- Balance expiry date is now optionalYou can now choose whether a policy should have an expiry rule or not
- Better visibility & balance historyWe improved how balances are shown, including:Clear display of negative balanceClear breakdown of accrued, used and available timeVisibility of any remaining separate negative balance created during the previous Time Off feature update
- Clear display of negative balance
- Clear breakdown of accrued, used and available time
- Visibility of any remaining separate negative balance created during the previous Time Off feature update

## What you need to do#

### Review your Time Off policies#

We strongly recommend that all admins review their Time Off policies to make sure everything is set correctly after the update. . We chose not to automate this process to avoid potential errors or misinterpretations of your specific company policies and to give you full control.To check your time off policies:

1. Navigate to theTime Offpage2. Click thegear icon3. SelectManage policies4. Click on thethree-dot iconnext to the policy you are reviewing5. SelectEdit6. Check the policy according to these options:

- Balance accrual expiry
- Automatic accrual
- Negative balance and limit (days) per year
- Reset negative balance

7. ClickSave

### Review balance expiry settings#

- Does this policy actually require an expiry rule?
- If not, selectNever expiresoption

More onexpiry settings

### Reset negative balance#

When setting up a time off policy, you can choose to automatically clear the user’s negative time off balance at the end of each period (month or year).

Reset negative balance is optional and is disabled by default.

IfReset negative balanceis enabled, any negative time off accumulated will be wiped clean and set back to 0 at the end of the period.

This does not affect the user’s earned (positive) available balance.

## What looks different#

You will notice updated screens that make balance information easier to understand:

### Unified balance view#

We have simplified how totals are calculated by unifying positive and negative balances into a single amount.For example, if a user has-5 daysand you add10 days, their new balance will be5 days.

Any “leftover” amount from the previous version, it will appear as aseparate negative balance.

To manage total balance:

- Check theBalancetable for the total balance and any separate negative amount
- UseAdd to balanceorBulk editto align the amount with your requirements
- OpenBalance historyto see how these adjustments affect the total amount

### Balance table#

Balance table gives you a clear view of your available time off.It displaystotal balance(current, unified amount of time off) +separate negative balance(appears if user has a “leftover” negative balance from the previous version).

### Balance details#

Balance details table displays:

- Accrued
- Used
- Available
- Negative days
- Upcoming accruals
- Whether negative days will reset

### Manage balance#

Admins see all balance components in one place, including any remaining separate negative balance.

### Quick comparison guide: Balance calculation before & after the update#

The most significant change is how adding balance interacts with the existing negative balances.

| Feature | Before update | After update |
| Add to balancemanually | Adds to the positive balance.Example: User has -5 days. You add 3 days. They now have 3 positive days and -5 negative days. | Option to choose if it affects negative balance first.Example (ifAffect negative balanceis selected): User has -5 days. You add 3 days. Their balance is now -2 days. |
| Balance visibility | Negative balance wasn’t visually separated from the positive balance on the UI. | Negative balance will be separated visually from the positive balance on the UI. |
| Accruals/Bulk adds | All automatic accruals and bulk additions were added only to the positive balance. | All automatic accruals and bulk additions will affect the negative balance first. |
| Individual negative | Negative balance could only be configured at the policy level and was only visible after positive balance was fully used. | Ability to see a negative balance for individual users on the Balance tab. |
| Negative reset | All negative days were automatically reset/deleted based on the policy’s limit period. | An option to reset all negative days will be available based on the limit period. |

## Exports#
